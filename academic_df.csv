2011,1,Katerina Tsetsura,Is Public Relations a Real Job? How Female Practitioners Construct the Profession,"This study examined how female practitioners' discourses shape perceptions of public relations as an emerging field in Russia. Interviews with 25 practitioners from Moscow public relations agencies showed that a prism of a real job and a woman's job can help explain how socio-economic, professional, and gender-defined contexts influence practitioners' perceptions of public relations and provided evidence for understanding public relations as a socially constructed gendered profession. The study found that Russian women construct their professional identities in gendered ways that may limit their career opportunities.",academic_research,"Is Public Relations a Real Job?

Employing a telephone survey of registered voters (n = 508), we investigated the interaction of politically relevant relationship antecedents, relationship cultivation strategies used by political parties, perceptions of the organization-public relationship between voters and their party, and outcomes of the relationship to test a model of political organization-public relationships (POPRs). Time, interpersonal trust, mediated communication, interpersonal communication, and dialogic communication emerged as significant predictors of POPR strength. The findings lay the groundwork for further investigation of POPRs.",academic_research,"Toward a Model of Political Organization-Public Relationships: Antecedent and Cultivation Strategy Influence on Citizens' Relationships with Political PartiesThis study examined the organization-public relationship between citizens and their political parties against the backdrop of the 2008 presidential general election.

2011,1,Seow Ting Lee & I.-Huei Cheng,Characteristics and Dimensions of Ethical Leadership in Public Relations,"This study explores the characteristics of leadership in developing and managing ethics in public relations, based on in-depth interviews with 20 public relations executives in the United States. Systematic analysis of the interview data identified multiple dimensions of ethical leadership and ethical knowledge, and suggested that ethical leadership is grounded in personal rather than professional characteristics. Personal ethics, interpersonal behaviors, and articulation of ethical standards emerged as 3 salient characteristics of an ideal leader in facilitating knowledge transfer of ethics in public relations organizations. Ethical knowledge is implicit, intangible, personal, and often difficult to identify or articulate, posing a challenge for the transfer of knowledge through structured and formalized approaches. Theoretical implications and practical recommendations are discussed.",academic_research,"Characteristics and Dimensions of Ethical Leadership in Public RelationsThis study explores the characteristics of leadership in developing and managing ethics in public relations, based on in-depth interviews with 20 public relations executives in the United States.

White,Organization-Public Relationships and Crisis Response Strategies: Impact on Attribution of Responsibility,"The study examines how relationships with an organization and crisis response strategy affect attribution of crisis responsibility. Participants were exposed to 1 of 4 different crisis response strategies, manipulated through news articles. The study measured perceptions of the organization–public relationship, and after exposure to 1 of the 4 news articles, attribution of crisis responsibility. People with a positive relationship with the organization were less likely to place blame for the crisis on the organization regardless of crisis response strategy. The study provides evidence that maintaining positive relationships with stakeholders may be more important that individual crisis strategies.",academic_research,"Organization-Public Relationships and Crisis Response Strategies: Impact on Attribution of ResponsibilityThe study examines how relationships with an organization and crisis response strategy affect attribution of crisis responsibility.

2011,1,Melanie James,A Provisional Conceptual Framework for Intentional Positioning in Public Relations,"Positioning within public relations is a concept not often addressed in public relations literature. This article reports on the progress of a project that aims to develop a way in which positioning could be usefully conceptualized within public relations. It suggests a conceptual framework that takes positioning beyond the marketing definitions that have limited use in the broader public relations field. The article reports on the development of a provisional conceptual framework for intentional positioning within a public relations context. Drawing from recent developments in positioning theory in the field of psychology, a framework was developed and applied to 57 award winning public relations campaign entries. Findings reveal that the positioning framework has the potential to be applied both as an heuristic to aid analysis of practice and also as a framework to aid practitioners in designing positioning strategies. Possibilities for further research are discussed.",academic_research,"A Provisional Conceptual Framework for Intentional Positioning in Public RelationsPositioning within public relations is a concept not often addressed in public relations literature.

2011,2,Jiyang Bae & Sun-A Park,Socio-Contextual Influences on the Korean News Media's Interpretation of Samsung's $847.6 Million Donation,"By content analyzing a multinational company's philanthropic activities after a series of illegal issues based on the framework of the contingency theory of conflict management, Shoemaker and Reese's (1996) onion model of media message production process, and crisis communication theory, this study shows that the failure to fulfill legal responsibility cannot satisfy the important public (mass media in this case), even though the company tries to fulfill philanthropic responsibility as a crisis communication strategy. Although Samsung wanted to express its apology through a donation, the Korean news media interpreted Samsung's philanthropic donation as an excuse or justification to minimize negative outcomes such as a tarnished reputation. The different interpretations of the donation by Samsung and the Korean news media can be attributed to the sudden change of corporate stance, influence of similar events of other companies, and socio-contextual factors (i.e., media types and affiliation).",academic_research,"Socio-Contextual Influences on the Korean News Media's Interpretation of Samsung's $847.6 Million DonationBy content analyzing a multinational company's philanthropic activities after a series of illegal issues based on the framework of the contingency theory of conflict management, Shoemaker and Reese's (1996) onion model of media message production process, and crisis communication theory, this study shows that the failure to fulfill legal responsibility cannot satisfy the important public (mass media in this case), even though the company tries to fulfill philanthropic responsibility as a crisis communication strategy.

Results of discriminant function analysis suggested that U.S. professionals place greater importance on strategic communication or problem-solving activities than do Korean practitioners.

2011,2,Soo Yeon Hong & Sung-Un Yang,Public Engagement in Supportive Communication Behaviors toward an Organization: Effects of Relational Satisfaction and Organizational Reputation in Public Relations Management,"Over the years, the understanding of the link between organization–public relationships and reputation constructs and their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes has advanced considerably. The Excellence Study (L. Grunig, J. Grunig, & Dozier, 2002) suggested that positive relationships built and maintained between organizations and publics can encourage publics to engage in supportive behaviors toward organizations. In support of this argument, Ki and Hon (2007b) empirically demonstrated the link between organization–public relationships and a public's supportive attitude and behavioral intentions toward an organization. Their findings show that among the four relationship indicators—control mutuality, trust, satisfaction, and commitment—relational satisfaction a public has with the organization had the strongest direct impact on the public's supportive attitude and indirect effects on behavioral intentions toward the organization. From the reputation management perspective, Fombrun pointed out that reputation “produces support for the company” (Fombrun & van Riel, 2003, p. 5), and added that reputation should be fostered because it affects publics' behaviors beneficial to organizations (Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun & van Riel, 2003). Empirical findings from recent studies support this view. Sung and Yang (2008) found that the reputation of a university perceived by its students had significant influence on their supportive attitudes toward the university. Also, in the context of country reputation, Yang, Shin, Lee and Wrigley (2008) found that the reputation of Korea perceived by foreigners had a strong effect on their supportive intentions toward Korea. As an extension to this line of research, the current study proposes to examine the effects of both relational satisfaction—a critical dimension of organization–public relationships—and organizational reputation on customers' supportive behaviors toward an organization, especially communication behaviors such as engagement in positive word-of-mouth communication and use of organizational media. Furthermore, this study aims to examine the critical mediation role of customers' identification with a company in the effects of relational satisfaction and organizational reputation on supportive communication behaviors.",academic_research,"Public Engagement in Supportive Communication Behaviors toward an Organization: Effects of Relational Satisfaction and Organizational Reputation in Public Relations ManagementOver the years, the understanding of the link between organization–public relationships and reputation constructs and their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes has advanced considerably.

2011,2,Sora Kim,Transferring Effects of CSR Strategy on Consumer Responses: The Synergistic Model of Corporate Communication Strategy,"This study proposes a synergistic model of corporate communication strategy (corporate ability strategy, corporate social responsibility strategy, and hybrid strategy) on consumer responses and tests the model using 2 Fortune 500 companies (Kellogg and Motorola). The study found that when a company is well-known to consumers as Motorola and Kellogg used in this study, a CSR strategy is more effective in influencing both consumer corporate ability (CAb) and CSR associations and in turn, company/product evaluations. Additionally, consumers tend to automatically assume a company is good at making reliable products when they associate the company with strong CSR, indicating transferring effects of CSR associations onto CAb associations, and onto company/product evaluations. The study results also suggest that the direct influences of CSR associations differ based on industry type. A company that produces high risk involved products such as Motorola, might not experience as strong CSR associations' effects on consumer responses as a company in other industry type like Kellogg.",academic_research,"Transferring Effects of CSR Strategy on Consumer Responses: The Synergistic Model of Corporate Communication StrategyThis study proposes a synergistic model of corporate communication strategy (corporate ability strategy, corporate social responsibility strategy, and hybrid strategy) on consumer responses and tests the model using 2 Fortune 500 companies (Kellogg and Motorola).

2011,3,Jeong-Nam Kim & Yunna Rhee,Strategic Thinking about Employee Communication Behavior (ECB) in Public Relations: Testing the Models of Megaphoning and Scouting Effects in Korea,"In public relations, employees are regarded as one of the most important strategic constituencies because they interact with external publics on a daily basis. However, employees' communication behavior (ECB) has not been extensively researched in public relations. The purpose of this research was to conceptualize and develop concrete measurements of ECB that can help theoretical development and strategic planning in public relations. In particular, the study identified two unique aspects of ECB—megaphoning and scouting—that refer to employees' voluntary efforts to collect and circulate strategic information externally and internally. In addition, a new concept, microboundary spanning, based on the two aspects of ECB is conceptualized. In this study, symmetrical internal communication and employee-organization relationships were posited as antecedent variables to the proposed ECB variables. A survey research was conducted with 300 employees in different types of organizations in Korea.",academic_research,"Strategic Thinking about Employee Communication Behavior (ECB) in Public Relations: Testing the Models of Megaphoning and Scouting Effects in KoreaIn public relations, employees are regarded as one of the most important strategic constituencies because they interact with external publics on a daily basis.

This study uses Gudykunst's (1985, 2005) Anxiety and Uncertainty Management (AUM) theory as the theoretical framework to examine whether the effects from cultivation strategies to relationship outcomes are mediated through anxiety and uncertainty management. An online survey solicitation was sent to a university's international student listserv, and 246 participants from 32 countries completed the questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Results largely supported the hypotheses, and indicated that cultivation strategies have both direct and indirect effects on relational outcomes, partially mediated by uncertainty and anxiety.",academic_research,"Anxiety and Uncertainty Management in an Intercultural Setting: The Impact on Organization–Public RelationshipsPast research has found that relationship cultivation strategies affect relationship outcomes.

This study examines the manner in which press agentry shaped and animated this 6-year historical episode. It portrays press agentry not merely in terms of personalities, but also in terms of a network of social and economic affiliations among promoters, sports celebrities, and the press.

2011,4,Debashish Munshi & Lee Edwards,Understanding ‘Race’ In/And Public Relations: Where Do We Start and Where Should We Go?,"Our starting point for a broader discussion on ‘race’ 1 in/and public relations (PR) is that, despite its virtual invisibility in the scholarly literature, race is firmly embedded in the context and practice of PR. Although scholars are slowly beginning to engage with race (e.g., Edwards, 2010b; Pompper, 2005; 2010; Waymer, 2010), PR scholarship has not yet paid sufficient attention to the ‘raced’ nature of the field. The dominant, functional perspectives of PR concentrate primarily on organizational goals, apparently oblivious to the impact that such goals have in relation to issues of race. On the other hand, critical approaches look at PR as a social and cultural phenomenon but these too, by and large, bypass race as an inherent part of the social and cultural domain. This special issue received many manuscripts, all encouraging in their attempts to address race. However, as we considered each one, we realized that we were perhaps more radical than most in our understanding of race.

According to study participants, strategic decision-making capability, problem-solving ability, and communication knowledge and expertise are the three most important qualities of excellent leadership. In addition, respondents said that on-the-job experiences, individual initiative and desire, and role models are the most valuable sources of leadership skills and development. About half of the respondents indicated that excellent leaders in public relations are different from leaders in other fields in three ways: They must hold a compelling vision for communication, possess comprehensive understanding of media and information systems, and effectively develop and implement strategic communication plans. Professional women and men in the study viewed excellent leadership in more or less similar ways.

By using individuals’ cognitive perceptions of government and participation in social organizations, as well as media use and demographic characteristics, as public segmentation criteria, a cluster analysis of international survey datasets of the United States and 19 European countries generated 3 public segments in each country. The largest cluster, named the underserved inactive majority, and representing a low level of income and education, low interest in politics, low trust in others, low citizenship standards, and minimal social participation, contrasted with the smallest cluster, named the satisfied active public. The identified segments differed in trust in governmental institutions, which is a key indicator of the quality of government–public relationships. Overall, the underserved inactive majority reported the lowest trust in governmental institutions, whereas citizen trust among the satisfied active public was the highest. This study highlights the theoretical and practical values of broad-based public segmentation in government public relations from the relationship-building perspective of public relations, rather than from a problem-solving perspective.

A consistently recurring theme during initial data analysis was the role of public relations in creating positive perceptions of Lerner as an owner. This ran contrary to the experiences of his American counterparts at other clubs. The British press, as well as academic researchers of sport globalization, has warned against the loss of localized rituals and institutions in the wake of the “foreign invasion” (Osborne & Coombs, 2009).

The Integrated Crisis Mapping (ICM) model is based on a publics-based, emotion-driven perspective where the publics' responses to different crises are mapped on 2 continua, the organization's engagement in the crisis and primary publics' coping strategy. This multistage testing found evidence that anxiety was the default emotion that publics felt in crises. The subsequent emotions felt by the publics varied in different quadrants involving different crisis types. As far as coping strategies were concerned, conative coping was more evident than cognitive coping across the 4 quadrants. Evidence also suggested strong merit that conative coping was the external manifestation of the internal cognitive processing that had taken place. Cognitive coping was thus the antecedent of conative coping. Although both the publics and the organizations agreed that the crises were relevant to the organizations' goals, they differed on who should assume more responsibility. The findings, although still very much exploratory, suggest theoretical rigor in the model, with room for further refinements to generate what Yin (2003) termed “analytic generalization” (p. 33) for the ICM model.",academic_research,"Toward a Publics-Driven, Emotion-Based Conceptualization in Crisis Communication: Unearthing Dominant Emotions in Multi-Staged Testing of the Integrated Crisis Mapping (ICM) ModelTo better understand not only the minds, but also the hearts of key publics, we have developed a more systemic approach to understand the responses of audiences in crisis situations.

How Women Public Relations Practitioners Make Meaning of Power,"This qualitative study examines how women public relations practitioners make meaning of power. From literature regarding power-control theory, gender, and empowerment, one research question was posed: How do women public relations practitioners make meaning of power? Results suggest that women practitioners made meaning of power as influence, relationships, knowledge and information, access, results-based credibility, and empowerment. The data extended power-control theory and scholarship regarding empowerment and uniquely added a gendered lens to the examination of power in public relations. Women practitioners actively enact influence, strategically forge relationships and gain and control information to affect their power.",academic_research,"Power-Control or Empowerment?

The model proposes that public relations practitioners' trait-level intercultural competence (empathy, open-mindedness, and flexibility) affect their perceptual-level competence (anxiety and uncertainty management), which in turn influence their behavioral-level competence (public relations practices) and the consequent relational quality with the publics. Structural equal modeling was used to analyze the data from 90 practitioners with rich intercultural public relations experiences. Results indicated that trait competence components worked differently in reducing practitioners' uncertainty and anxiety. Such distress reduction enhanced the use of symmetrical and two-way public relations. Finally, symmetrical public relations and lowered anxiety increased practitioners' perceptions of trust and control mutuality in the relationships their organizations had with the publics.

This scenario-based experimental study validates the usefulness of the CA–CSR crisis categorization by demonstrating that not only do people actually discern differences between these two types of crises, but their awareness of a crisis type also influences their interpretation of the crisis, as well as their perceptions of and attitudes toward the target firm. In particular, this study shows that a CSR crisis, versus a CA crisis, is interpreted more seriously and, consequently, causes heavier damage to the evaluation of the firm. In addition, the halo effect of a favorable prior reputation was found in the CA crisis condition, but not in the CSR condition. Based on these findings, this study suggests that the recognition of CA and CSR crises provides a boundary condition, which determines divergent effects of crises on perceivers' evaluation of the target firm.",academic_research,"Understanding Reputational Crisis: Definition, Properties, and ConsequencesTo better understand the nature of reputational crisis, this study examined two crisis events using the corporate ability (CA) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) crisis categorization frameworks.

Differential influences of emotional type and intensity on coping and crisis response preferences were found. Interaction effects revealed: (a) more intense sympathetic feelings lead to higher likelihood of conative coping preference; (b) more sympathy at low intensity contributes to more preference of active cognitive coping and acceptance of accommodative organizational responses; and (c) more intense anger is related to acceptance of more defensive crisis response such as scapegoating.",academic_research,"Examining Publics' Crisis Responses According to Different Shades of Anger and SympathyIntegrating the discrete emotions and emotional dimensionality theories in crisis communication research, a 2 (emotional type: anger vs. sympathy) × 2 (emotional intensity: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment using a random general public sample was designed to examine the variance in publics' crisis coping strategies and their acceptance of different organizational crisis responses, as a function of crisis-induced anger and sympathy of different intensity.

In 1940, as part of a widespread propaganda campaign to assuage public concerns about industry and rehabilitate big business's reputation, NAM created and distributed the community relations short film, Your Town. The movie, pursuing an integration propaganda strategy, appealed to Americans' individualistic values by portraying industry as a beneficent fellow traveler who was a big individual—a heroic, larger-than-life figure who could make the land profitable and guard the citizenry against evil, antibusiness influences. Applying Vogler's (1997) synthesis of Campbell's (1949) heroic narrative form, this article shows that NAM's portrayal of industry as a hero has continued to resonate with strains of contemporary American thought that (a) sees business as the foundation for societal progress and stability and (b) conceptualizes the corporate entity as a person.

2014,4,Kevin Stoker,Paradox in Public Relations: Why Managing Relating Makes More Sense Than Managing Relationships,"This article applies research on paradox, semantics, and theories of groups and logical types to public relations, particularly the concept of relationship management. Paradoxes create tension and are often produced by semantic disturbances resulting from errors in logical typing. Communication is inherently paradoxical.

We applied a social network conceptual framework to identify and characterize social mediators that connect the US State Department with its international public. The results showed that social mediators vary in terms of their formality and interdependence. Formal social mediators were primarily US government agencies while informal social mediators were nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals. Notably, relationships with populations in the Middle East and North Africa were mediated primarily by informal actors, and formal mediators played a key role in connecting the public with everywhere else in the world. Government-related formal mediators and informal social mediators showed similar levels of bilateral relationships. In contrast, news media, the most traditional public relations mediators, were rarely found as social mediators and demonstrated the most unilateral relationships.",academic_research,"A Social Networks Approach to Public Relations on Twitter: Social Mediators and Mediated Public RelationsThis study proposes theoretical and practical frameworks to systematically examine mediated public relations in social media spaces.

2015,3,Tom Watson,"Time Marches On, and So Does the History of Public Relations","This is the first, and hopefully not the last, special issue on the history of public relations in the Journal of Public Relations Research. It has been very oversubscribed in terms of submissions and a challenge to select six papers from so many entries. This problem is actually a sign of scholarly health with symptoms of a wide range of topics from numerous parts of the world. For those who are new to this field of research and scholarship, it may be a surprise that the expansion of historical research into public relations has taken off in the past 8 years. Although there had been sporadic publication of articles in journals and some important texts, notably by Hiebert (1966), Cutlip (1994, 1995), Ewen (1996), Marchand (1998), Tye (1998), Miller (1999) and Griese (2001), it was not a field that was thriving. As indicated by the nation of these authors, it appeared to be wholly based in the United States and lacked an international dimension. That was an erroneous view as scholars such as Michael Kunczik, Günter Bentele and Peter Szyszka in Germany, Karl Nessmann in Austria and Jacquie L'Etang in the United Kingdom had published articles and books from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s but with recognition limited by language and exposure in the main public relations academic journals. The expansion took place after a ‘History of public relations’ special issue in the Journal of Communication Management (2008, Vol 12, No. 4) prompted the organization of the annual International History of Public Relations Conference (IHPRC) at Bournemouth University in England from 2010 onward. This specialist conference has been the platform on which historians of public relations and academic researchers reflecting on the historical influences upon theory and practice have presented their research. Around 170 papers have been presented by authors from more than 40 countries during the first five conferences. Some of the papers submitted to this special issue arose from IHPRC 2014 presentations. In addition to conference proceedings (available at http://historyofpr.com), there has been expansion of academic publishing in book form from leading publishers such as Routledge and Palgrave Macmillan, and of journal articles. The discovery stage in which national histories have been written, personalities and influencers identified, and practices explored have provided the bulk of scholarship. At the time of writing, a series of books on National Perspectives on the Development of Public Relations covering 73 countries in all continents and regions other than North America is being published by Palgrave (Watson, 2014/2015). This includes countries of which little has been researched on the evolution of public relations (e.g., Bulgaria, Indonesia, Uganda, the nations of Central America) and those which are well-explored (Germany, United Kingdom). As this stage has continued, it has become evident that there is no single model of public relations and the concept of public relations is broadly interpreted with important cultural variations that operate alongside the internationalized practices of the agency networks and corporations. Research into archives, oral histories and documentary analysis has buttressed similar findings from studies into global practices of public relations (e.g., Sriramesh & Verčič, 2009). However, the scholarship has moved on to more analytical and critical approaches (Watson, 2014), with increasing discourse on historiography. The emphasis, as expressed in major text books used around the world, on Great Men such as Ivy L. Lee, Edward Bernays, and Arthur W. Page and that public relations was invented in the United States is being challenged by research into formative influences on public relations (Lamme & Russell, 2010; Wakefield, 2013) and by noncorporatist perspectives (Coombs & Holladay, 2012; Somerville & Purcell, 2011). The critical approach to history has followed on from McKie and Munshi's (2007) argument that many public relations historical accounts “are unique and unchallenged, or under-challenged, and in need of pluralising with robust perspectives” (p. 119) and “align with a modernist perspective” (p. 120). The critical approach (L'Etang, 2008, 2014; Logan, 2014; McKie & Xifra 2014) has refreshed understanding of public relations by contextualizing it within social and organizational frames, and the pressures and influences that shape communication. Previously it had often been presented as a stand-alone practice with professional ambitions that existed outside organizational, social, political and economic contexts. The six articles that follow in this special issue extend the historiographical debate (Jordi Xifra and Robert L. Heath), consider the emergence of public relations within the Franco dictatorship of mid-century Spain (Natalia Rodriguez-Salcedo), introduce Peitho, the Greek goddess of persuasion (Charles Marsh), explore the role of public relations in the communications efforts of the French Resistance in World War II (Gareth Thompson), place Chinese public relations within the modernization of that country (Baijing Hu, Christine Yi Hui Huang, and Di Zhang), and review the rejection by U.S. religious communicators to public relations as a concept and operational term (Douglas F. Cannon). They are a rich tapestry of historical research that widen our understanding of public relations as being much more than the management of communications in a corporate mould. To choose six from 28 submissions has been very difficult, and as guest editor, I am most grateful for the 60 or so reviewers who have given their time, knowledge, and academic scrutiny to all the articles. They, and all the authors, have contributed to the continuing expansion of the history of public relations.",academic_research,"Time Marches On, and So Does the History of Public RelationsThis is the first, and hopefully not the last, special issue on the history of public relations in the Journal of Public Relations Research.

At the time of writing, a series of books on National Perspectives on the Development of Public Relations covering 73 countries in all continents and regions other than North America is being published by Palgrave (Watson, 2014/2015). This includes countries of which little has been researched on the evolution of public relations (e.g., Bulgaria, Indonesia, Uganda, the nations of Central America) and those which are well-explored (Germany, United Kingdom). As this stage has continued, it has become evident that there is no single model of public relations and the concept of public relations is broadly interpreted with important cultural variations that operate alongside the internationalized practices of the agency networks and corporations. Research into archives, oral histories and documentary analysis has buttressed similar findings from studies into global practices of public relations (e.g., Sriramesh & Verčič, 2009). However, the scholarship has moved on to more analytical and critical approaches (Watson, 2014), with increasing discourse on historiography. The emphasis, as expressed in major text books used around the world, on Great Men such as Ivy L. Lee, Edward Bernays, and Arthur W. Page and that public relations was invented in the United States is being challenged by research into formative influences on public relations (Lamme & Russell, 2010; Wakefield, 2013) and by noncorporatist perspectives (Coombs & Holladay, 2012; Somerville & Purcell, 2011). The critical approach to history has followed on from McKie and Munshi's (2007) argument that many public relations historical accounts “are unique and unchallenged, or under-challenged, and in need of pluralising with robust perspectives” (p. 119) and “align with a modernist perspective” (p. 120). The critical approach (L'Etang, 2008, 2014; Logan, 2014; McKie & Xifra 2014) has refreshed understanding of public relations by contextualizing it within social and organizational frames, and the pressures and influences that shape communication. Previously it had often been presented as a stand-alone practice with professional ambitions that existed outside organizational, social, political and economic contexts. The six articles that follow in this special issue extend the historiographical debate (Jordi Xifra and Robert L. Heath), consider the emergence of public relations within the Franco dictatorship of mid-century Spain (Natalia Rodriguez-Salcedo), introduce Peitho, the Greek goddess of persuasion (Charles Marsh), explore the role of public relations in the communications efforts of the French Resistance in World War II (Gareth Thompson), place Chinese public relations within the modernization of that country (Baijing Hu, Christine Yi Hui Huang, and Di Zhang), and review the rejection by U.S. religious communicators to public relations as a concept and operational term (Douglas F. Cannon). They are a rich tapestry of historical research that widen our understanding of public relations as being much more than the management of communications in a corporate mould. To choose six from 28 submissions has been very difficult, and as guest editor, I am most grateful for the 60 or so reviewers who have given their time, knowledge, and academic scrutiny to all the articles. They, and all the authors, have contributed to the continuing expansion of the history of public relations."
2015,3,Jordi Xifra & Robert L. Heath,"Reputation, Propaganda, and Hegemony in Assyriology Studies: A Gramscian View of Public Relations Historiography","The aim of this article is to revisit the robust interest in the history of public relations, including its role on behalf of organizations and communities. Energy for that effort is being generated by recent discussions of propaganda and reputation in Assyriology. Major archeological findings of the 2nd half of the twentieth century revealed texts explicating a system of public communication, the purpose of which was to legitimize the power of monarchs in the ancient Near East. Founded on written (royal inscriptions) and iconographic materials and influenced by the historical materialism predominant in historiography when Assyriology was at its height, Assyriologists have approached the study of Mesopotamian state ideology via an essentially communicative dimension where the search for legitimacy and hegemony is articulated through communication in the form of impression and reputation management. To that end, Gramsci's state theory, in particular his conception of historical blocs—dominant configurations of material capabilities, ideologies and institutions as determining frames for individual and collective action—are deemed useful for a critical view of public relations historiography.",academic_research,"Reputation, Propaganda, and Hegemony in Assyriology Studies: A Gramscian View of Public Relations HistoriographyThe aim of this article is to revisit the robust interest in the history of public relations, including its role on behalf of organizations and communities.

The first consultancy was opened in Barcelona in 1960, at the beginning of a period of economic growth due to a change of direction in the regime. After the end of the autarchy and international ostracism, Spain began an unprecedented economic and social transformation.

It describes the clandestine media relations operations of the French Resistance in World War II as undertaken by the Bureau d'Information et de Presse (BIP), which was established in April 1942 by the Resistance leader Jean Moulin and led by the ex-journalist Georges Bidault, who went on to be foreign minister and then Prime Minister in post-war France. Beyond a descriptive narrative of the BIP, the article attempts an evaluation of the role of the BIP in the Resistance and suggests that Resistance historiography has emphasized armed action and largely overlooked the BIP's importance.

2016,2,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay,"Since taking on the work of editing this journal in January 2015, I have become increasingly reflective regarding the myriad challenges facing public relations scholarship—and, indeed, these same challenges threaten scholarly activity in any discipline. In particular, I have been thinking a lot about Campbell’s Law (1979/2011), which states that “The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor” (2011, p. 34). Let’s consider Campbell’s Law in the context of academic research and publication: We all know that tenure and promotion at universities—no matter what kind of universities—increasingly is contingent on scholarly activity. Whether the standard is publishing five peer-reviewed articles per year or five such articles over the span of one’s tenure-earning timeframe or clock, the pressure felt by authors is real. “Publish or perish”—long an adage in the academy—has become a nuclear arms race in which publications are stockpiled onto CVs but seldom used (i.e., read), except perhaps by other authors building the literature review portions of their own manuscripts that they, in turn, seek to publish. This is a problem. Obvi. At least, it’s a problem if we care about being a true community of scholars, as opposed to an army of article producers. Excellent thought- and research-provoking scholarship used to generate citations precisely because of their heuristic value, their ability to generate reflection, dialog, debate, and subsequent scholarship. Now, the generating of citations seems to be an end unto itself, with some authors promoting their new publications via social media and, in some cases, outright asking others to cite them. We in public relations, of all disciplines, should know that the line is fine between informing the public and promoting the self (whether individual or organizational) and that the micro- and meso-level interests of individuals and organizations must be balanced against the macro-level interests of society and community. I have no solutions to this problem. And perhaps the only possible solutions are ones that individual scholars find for and within themselves, balancing their professional aspirations in the game of tenure and promotion with their personal willingness to play that game, to the extent necessary at their institutions. For and in the community of public relations scholars, I can only do my best to stay true to the primary purpose of this journal, which is to create, test, refine or expand public relations theory. Inside this issue I still believe in the heuristic value of theoretically grounded and methodologically sound research, as well as in the ability of such articles to generate their own citations. But, just in case, let me facilitate those citations by summarizing here the value of each article for our public relations scholarly community. (I won’t, however, promote the articles on social media; one has to draw a line somewhere!) Effects of crisis efficacy on intentions to follow directives during crisis This article by Elizabeth Avery and Sejin Park is both theoretically and pragmatically significant. First, the authors propose a new theoretical construct of crisis efficacy, not only explicating how this term differs conceptually from both self-efficacy and response efficacy, but also testing those distinctions, with statistically significant results. Their finding that crisis efficacy predicts willingness to follow directives in crisis situations enhances our understanding of the “cognitive mechanisms underlying audience processing of crisis instructing information” (p. 72). The study is valuable because it focuses on an oft-neglected piece of reality in crisis management research: that the consequences of crises extend beyond damage to an organization to very real people, be they consumers, residents or other stakeholders. Furthermore, this article brings scholarly attention to the least-studied stage of crisis management (the pre-crisis), while offering practical value for practitioners trying to design instructive messages for the public to use during crises. The value of public relations: Different impacts of communal and exchange relationships on perceptions and communicative behavior While Avery and Park investigate how cognitions and attitudes affect behaviors during a crisis, Jarim Kim and Minjung Sung examine the impact of organization–public relationships on cognitions and attitudes, as well as—ultimately—on communicative behaviors. Grounded in the situational theory of publics (Grunig, 1997) and its successor theory, the situational theory of problem solving (Kim & Grunig, 2011), this article probes the differential impacts of exchange versus communal relationships. Theoretically, this study is valuable because it further opens up the black box of processes by which publics become activists, including motivation and political inclination as additional considerations. Methodologically, the study is useful in reminding us that student samples remain appropriate primarily when the research purpose is to generalize to student populations. Pragmatically, this research is instructive in statistically demonstrating the value of communal relationships over exchange relationships, which may encourage organizations to invest the time and resources necessary to develop the former. Effects of attributed responsibility and response strategies on organizational reputation: A meta-analysis of situational crisis communication theory research Liang Ma and Mengqi (Monica) Zhan offer value to public relations scholars by presenting results of a meta-analysis of research on how organizational reputation is affected by both attributed responsibility and crisis response strategies. Driven largely by Coombs’ (1995, 2007) popular situational crisis communication theory (SCCT), this area of scholarship generally has offered two propositions: first, that public attribution of crisis responsibility affects organizational reputation; and second, that organizational crisis-response strategies should match the level of responsibility attributed by publics to organizations for their crises. Underscoring the theoretical value of SCCT, Liang and Zhan’s meta-analysis found support for both propositions, albeit in differing strengths: “Although attributed responsibility posed severe threat to organizational reputation, responding to a crisis according to attributed responsibility was not enough to protect reputation” (p. 113). From a methodological standpoint, this article is helpful to scholars in reminding us that a proper meta-analysis includes actual statistical analysis, i.e., meta-analysis is not merely a discussion of a collection of results from myriad scholarly works. Also, this study offers three key considerations for public relations researchers studying public response to crises. First, studies of organizational reputation must define this concept more clearly and operationalize it more carefully, distinguishing credibility from general favorability. Second, student samples do not reflect the heterogeneity of nonstudent populations and thus should be used only when studying populations of actual students, as Sung and Kim do in this issue. Finally, it may not matter whether real or fictitious crisis scenarios are used for research purposes. W. Timothy Coombs responds In the increasingly high-stakes, pressure-cooker world of academia, we may forget that the purpose of scholarly production is not merely to produce still-more research, enhance academic reputations, or gain citations of our work. Rather, a fundamental purpose of scholarly production is to offer researchers the opportunity to engage in critical thinking, scholarly reflection, and collegial dialogue. Thus, in an effort to facilitate the latter, I invited W. Timothy Coombs to reflect on the meta-analysis of SCCT research, with the manuscript’s authorship blinded to him. He was kind enough to engage in this effort, and consequently his invited article is the final piece in this issue of the Journal.",academic_research,"Editor’s essaySince taking on the work of editing this journal in January 2015, I have become increasingly reflective regarding the myriad challenges facing public relations scholarship—and, indeed, these same challenges threaten scholarly activity in any discipline. In particular, I have been thinking a lot about Campbell’s Law (1979/2011), which states that “The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor” (2011, p. 34). Let’s consider Campbell’s Law in the context of academic research and publication: We all know that tenure and promotion at universities—no matter what kind of universities—increasingly is contingent on scholarly activity. Whether the standard is publishing five peer-reviewed articles per year or five such articles over the span of one’s tenure-earning timeframe or clock, the pressure felt by authors is real. “Publish or perish”—long an adage in the academy—has become a nuclear arms race in which publications are stockpiled onto CVs but seldom used (i.e., read), except perhaps by other authors building the literature review portions of their own manuscripts that they, in turn, seek to publish. This is a problem. Obvi. At least, it’s a problem if we care about being a true community of scholars, as opposed to an army of article producers.

2016,3&4,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay,"Editing an academic journal is fraught with challenges, not least of which is helping authors to separate myth from reality. To that end, I would like to address here the myth that the Journal does not publish qualitative research. In short, this is complete and utter nonsense. Even a casual perusal of scholarship published in Journal of Public Relations Research since its inception shows that authors of both quantitative and qualitative research have been given a voice in these pages. Like any other editor who cares about citation indices and journal rankings (read: like every other editor), I want to publish the absolute best scholarship. Period. And by “best scholarship,” I mean research that is held to the highest standards for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. In quantitative research, the typical standards are internal and external validity, as well as reliability and replicability. Here are some ways in which those standards might “translate” for evaluating qualitative research: For details on each of these standards, please review the work of the authors cited. Or what the heck, use Google. To make these conceptual standards more concrete, let me offer here some specific questions for scholars planning to submit qualitative research to the Journal: Who are you? Reflexivity is an important component to qualitative scholarship because the researcher is “the instrument” in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. Thus, readers need to know more about you, your possible implicit biases in the treatment of data, and how you strived to mitigate those inherent biases. This effort is akin to our expectation that authors of survey-based manuscripts report the source(s) of their instrument items. What is your point? The primary purpose of this journal is to create, test, refine or expand public relations theory. You need to synthesize and interpret the data, connect it back to your theoretical framework, and articulate how the results of your qualitative research effort meet the purpose of this journal. If the results are merely descriptive of some phenomenon without an articulation of why that affects our understanding of public relations theory, then your manuscript needs some more work. Would we accept a manuscript from a quantitative scholar who merely submitted her/his SPSS data file as the “results” section? Of course not. But this is essentially what some qualitative scholars do when their manuscripts only present a bunch of raw quotes from various research participants, without contextualization, synthesis or interpretation. What drove your research choices? You did participant observation in Country X; explain why this country was appropriate for your research purpose. For example, was this the first or most recent country to experience the specific public relations phenomenon under study? Or did you just need a tax-deductible reason to visit Country X for summer break, so you did some “data collection” while there? You interviewed 25 people; explain why you stopped at this number. Was data saturation reached? Or did you run out of time or money? You did a focus group with practitioners from your region; explain why those specific participants had the expertise to help answer your research questions. For example, if you are studying social media use, are the managers in the focus group actually the ones with expertise executing those tactics? If you’re studying crisis response, did your interviewees actually have work experience managing organizational crises? Or did you just talk to your own practitioner friends and their acquaintances as your “snowball sample”? Having offered what I hope are helpful tips, let me now provide brief summaries of the quantitative and qualitative research given voice in this double issue. Development and test of a multidimensional scale of blog engagement In addition to proposing a (much-needed) three-item correlated model for blog engagement, the article by Toby Hopp and Tiffany Derville Gallicano offers readers helpful transparency regarding the procedures undertaken to develop the scale. Specifically, these researchers grounded their quantitative work for scale development in themes that had emerged from prior qualitative scholarship, thus illustrating one way in which qualitative research has the potential to inform quantitative research. The researchers also break new ground in their conceptualization of “social media engagement” as a multi-dimensional construct that encompasses utility, presence, virality, and personal connection. In doing so, they are careful to offer “blog engagement” (using only the dimensions of utility, presence, and virality) as one contextual application of “social media engagement,” rather than equating one construct to the other. This definition also enables public relations scholars to move forward from superficially discussing “social media engagement” when they are merely examining “online interactions.” Organizational listening: Addressing a major gap in public relations theory and practice The article by Jim Macnamara extends the concept of “listening” more systematically into public relations theory and practice. To begin, the author thoroughly documents the lack of serious theorizing by public relations scholars regarding the concept of listening and in that process distills five essential elements of public relations: Two-way communication, relationships, dialogue, engagement, and co-orientation. The study offers a good example of the value of qualitative research, not as a precursor to quantitative efforts, but as inherently valuable when undertaken using a naturalistic interpretive approach. The mention (on p. 154) of standards by which qualitative research can be evaluated may be particularly helpful to novice researchers. Specifically, the article demonstrates confirmability by offering a careful explanation of the author’s qualitative research sampling. The study’s multiple methods of data collection (i.e., in-depth interviews, document analysis and field experiments) enhance the credibility of the research. A message-focused measurement of the communication dimension of social capital: Revealing shared meaning in a network of relationships Adam J. Saffer offers a complex manuscript that carefully integrates social capital theory and symbolic convergence theory by focusing on the concepts of shared meaning and networks, all summarized neatly in a conceptual process model. This article lays a foundation for theory building in public relations in several ways. First, the conceptualization straddles a (mis?)perceived disciplinary divide between the “rhetorical” and “management/systems” approaches to public relations theory (see Toth & Heath, 1992). Scholars from an earlier generation may have grounded their work on their respective traditions of speech communication or mass communication, but I believe we have been seeing a transition to integrated scholarship drawing on the strengths of both traditions, which this article demonstrates. Secondly, and reflective of that scholarly integration, Saffer offers both a network analysis and a fantasy theme analysis, using data collected from multiple texts, qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey. This triangulation of methods sheds light on both networked social capital and shared social reality as organizational resources, and the manuscript demonstrates great thoroughness in explaining how data were collected and analyzed. Finally, the results of this study remind us that, no matter how effective public relations efforts may be in creating messages on behalf of organizations, organizational stakeholders will always create — over time, using multiple communication channels, across myriad contexts — their own shared meanings of those messages. Nonprofit relationship management: Extending the organization-public relationship to loyalty and behaviors Geah Nicole Pressgrove and Brooke Weberling McKeever advance the study of organization-public relationships by treating Hon and Grunig’s (1999) measures of trust, commitment and satisfaction not as relational outcomes, but as predictors of loyalty and behavioral intentions. They thus extend public relations theory by offering the concept of “loyalty” as an outcome of relationship maintenance strategies in public relations, admitting that this concept needs better measurement even as they offer a careful overview of prior research on loyalty and note its distinction from “commitment.” Conceptually, the authors review the dimensions of stewardship (responsibility, reporting, relationship-nurturing, and reciprocity), finding evidence that the latter dimension may in fact be a composite of private/personal regard and public recognition. Furthermore, the authors examine the extent to which that five-dimensional scale for measuring stewardship (see Pressgrove, 2016) has predictive validity for dimensions of organization-public relationships, considering whether different types of stakeholder groups are differentially affected. The study reported here poses many directions for research, not least because the high levels of multicollinearity suggest that the examined variables may in fact be dimensions of a single meta-concept, rather than reflective of independent concepts on their own. For example, what really is the difference – conceptual and operational – between “commitment” and “loyalty”? Only future research will tell.",academic_research,"Editor’s essayEditing an academic journal is fraught with challenges, not least of which is helping authors to separate myth from reality.

2016,3&4,Jim Macnamara,Organizational listening: Addressing a major gap in public relations theory and practice,"An extensive body of literature theorizes public relations as two-way communication, dialogue, and relationships between organizations and their publics.

2016,5&6,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay,"The world is full of divisions, various ways in which people set themselves apart from “Others” that are perceived—correctly or incorrectly—to be different. For example, we see in society divisions between the so-called progressives and conservatives, rural and urban areas, the rich and the poor, and the more educated and the less educated. Among the more educated, in the academy, we see divisions between the so-called hard sciences and social sciences, between more established disciplines (like sociology) and relative newcomers (like media studies). In any discipline (including public relations), we see divisions between scholars and practitioners, between academics from teaching colleges and those from research universities, and between researchers from one scholarly tradition and those from another. Perhaps the latter division is one reason we have a double-blind peer-review process for academic journals like this one. As more seasoned scholars know, double-blind means manuscript reviewers are blind to the identities of manuscript authors, and manuscript authors are blind to the identities of reviewers.1 On the plus side, the double-blind process of peer review means that, theoretically, reviewers can more objectively (or—at least—less subjectively) evaluate the quality of research under consideration for publication in this journal. On the minus side, no amount of authorship-blinding, reviewer training, or hand-wringing will ever fully eliminate bias in the review process. Why? Because each and every one of us holds implicit biases that affect how we see the world, whether or not we recognize their influences or impacts. Implicit bias Implicit bias is defined as the “attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner” (Staats, Capatosto, Wright, & Jackson, 2016, p. 14). Implicit bias is about social cognition, and it is “activated involuntarily, without awareness or intentional control. [It] can be either positive or negative. Everyone is susceptible” (p. 14). Implicit bias is endemic to society, and it is not just about race, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation. Implicit bias can also be about body size, weight, beauty, dialect, skin tone, physical ability, mental ability and health, marital status, even what time of day an employee shows up to the office. In one form or another, implicit bias has been found to affect supervisor evaluations of employees (Yam, Fehr, Barnes, Kozlowski, & Chen, 2014), treatment of patients by doctors and other health care providers (Chapman, Kaatz, & Carnes, 2013; John-Henderson, 2015; Zestcott, Blair, & Stone, 2016), police officers’ use of force on the job (Fridell & Lim, 2016), recruitment and hiring of job candidates (Cocchiara, Bell, & Casper, 2016; Nadler, Lowery, Grebinoski, Jones, & Gonsiorek, 2014), decisions about receivers of charitable microfinance lending (Jenq, Pan, & Theseira, 2015), graduate school admissions (Strunk & Bailey, 2015), disciplinary referrals of students (Girvan, Gion, Mcintosh, & Smolkowski, 2016) … the list goes on. Why we should care As public relations scholars, students, and practitioners, why should we care about implicit bias? I think we should care least of all that implicit bias affects the process of journal reviews, which, after all, has a relative safeguard in the double-blind peer-review process. Rather, we should consider that implicit bias affects the kind of research we choose to conduct and how we choose to conduct it. Why do we put our collective intellectual capacity behind the investigation of some issues and not others? Are the topics we study truly worthy of our intellect, our time, and our energy? And we should care more that implicit bias affects how we teach our students and advise our clients. Do we inadvertently disrespect those who need us, for their very need of our expertise? Are we so centered on ourselves that we forget to consider the impact of our words and our actions on those who are not like us? How do our implicit biases affect the grades we give and the employees we hire? Finally, I think we should especially care that the implicit bias of public relations practitioners affects how organizations build relationships with stakeholders, starting with the very decision of which stakeholders are “worth” building relationships with. Because at the end of the day, implicit bias is an unconscious judgment about value—who has it, and who does not. What we can do The scholarly literature across various disciplines is rife with examples of the real-world impacts of implicit bias, as well as with numerous studies suggesting ways in which implicit bias might be acknowledged, minimized, and mitigated (at least in its effects). I challenge each of us to reflect on our own implicit biases and to reach out to those who may be different from ourselves. Explain public relations to a colleague from biology or engineering; share what professors do at work with a neighbor who didn’t get the chance to attend college; or ask a public relations practitioner what drives her decisions on the job (because we know it’s probably not theory). Only by building bridges (and not walls) can we begin to overcome what divides us, one of those dividers being our own implicit biases toward others. Communicated commitment and conversational voice: Abbreviated measures of communicative strategies for maintaining organization-public relationships Kaye D. Sweetser and Tom Kelleher examine strategies that organizations can use to maintain relationships with their publics. Prior studies have shown that strategies for the maintenance of organization-public relationships (OPRs) include relational commitment, responsiveness/openness, human or conversational voice, positivity, and task sharing. Sweetser and Kelleher advance our scholarly understanding of OPR-maintenance strategies in two ways. First, the authors acknowledge the digital media context for all current efforts to maintain OPRs, and they incorporate that context into their research question for the study. Second, they use a rigorous, 3-phase process to reduce a measure of OPR-maintenance strategies from 25 items to an 11-item scale composed of two factors: Communicated commitment and conversational voice. The resultant tool has strong potential for advancing theory-building in public relations by enabling the collection of data from organizations that may have found the original 25-item measurement too long and cumbersome to use. We cannot move theory forward without data, and we cannot collect data when participants opt out of research due to lack of time or interest. Thus, the reduced 11-item scale developed by Sweetser and Kelleher serves public relations researchers across the academic-pragmatic divide. Why practitioners do (not) apply crisis communication theory in practice Although Sweetser and Kelleher (2016) offer an abbreviated measurement tool to facilitate better research by both academics and practitioners on the strategies to maintain organization-public relationships, An-Sofie Claeys and Michaël Opgenhaffen note that, often, “practically relevant research is not undertaken by academics” (2016, p. 233). Indeed, “there is nothing so practical as a good theory” (Lewin, 1951, p. 169). Yet, both anecdotal evidence and scholarly research tell us that public relations practitioners do not always follow theory-based guidelines, a problem that some have called the scholar-practitioner divide or the “rigor-relevance gap.” Claeys and Opgenhaffen explore this gap to shed light on specific reasons why practitioners who know principles of crisis communication still resist the application of those principles when faced with an actual crisis. They found that reasons for practitioners to not apply theory include considerations related to timing, circumstance, and context (both legal and cultural). The authors conclude their article with concrete suggestions for ways in which scholars and practitioners can better bridge the divide between theory and practice. Dimensions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) skepticism and their impacts on public evaluations toward CSR Like crisis communication, another area of interest to both scholars and practitioners has been corporate social responsibility or CSR, a term that seems more frequently used than it has ever been rigorously defined. To begin remedying the latter, Hyejoon Rim and Sora Kim draw on literature from various fields to distinguish the multidimensional concept of CSR skepticism from skepticism in its many other forms, exploring this concept as both a situational and dispositional trait. Then, the authors tested four statistical models to determine that publics’ responses toward CSR skepticism is best predicted by three factors: Skepticism toward a company’s CSR altruism, disbelief regarding a company’s CSR communications and activities, and skepticism toward the informativeness of a company’s CSR efforts. This study advances public relations theory by offering a strong conceptual definition of and measurement for CSR skepticism, and the article yields numerous directions for research, including future studies to validate the measurements proposed here, as well as to determine the applicability of those measurements to non-US populations. Beyond mere information transfer: The importance of a relational approach to market-related internal communication Turning from external communication of organizational CSR efforts, the article by David Jiménez-Castillo examines internal communication of market-related information and how this affects both the shared interpretation of information and the innovation performance of employees. The author reviews prior research distinguishing internal communication that builds relationships from communication that disseminates task- or job-related information, before advocating a “relational approach to market-related internal communication” (i.e., RAMIC) that integrates both approaches to employee communication, which he tests on Spanish manufacturing companies across different industries. Pragmatically, the results suggest that RAMIC enables organizations to manage the increasingly large amounts of market information and to share that information with employees in ways that do not overwhelm their information-processing capacity. Theoretically, the findings problematize extant conceptualizations of internal communication, which in public relations scholarship has centered on transactional approaches to building organization-employee relationships. Conceptually, the article offers an innovative way to connect marketing scholarship with public relations research beyond the trite 1980s’ turf wars of marketing versus public relations. Indeed, the findings suggest that “public relations managers should take a much more active role in managing communication processes linked to market information” (p. 276), thus underscoring the need for public relations and marketing to work together as organizational functions, rather than perpetuating their conceptual and functional divides.",academic_research,"Editor’s essayThe world is full of divisions, various ways in which people set themselves apart from “Others” that are perceived—correctly or incorrectly—to be different.

2017,1,Anastasios Theofilou,Editor’s essay,"Historical research within public relations is a relatively new field of scholarship. It may sound contradictory; however, the nature of the discipline and its dynamic expansion academically and professionally has, until recently, limited opportunity to research the phenomenon historically. Attempting to explore the past of the discipline signals, in part, a desire to understand the present and to an extent foresee future directions. This historical quest for knowledge though does not come without challenges. When focusing on historical research and historiography, public relations researchers must become historians, using the same techniques and appropriate methodological approaches as professional historians to explore and analyze the past. Perhaps there may still be skepticism on the ability to do so (J. Xifra, personal communication, July 7, 2016) or acknowledge the existence of professional prejudices (D. Wright, personal communication, July 6, 2016); however, recent scholarship provides a solid argument for the opposite viewpoint. One may also argue that existing tools and models used to capture historical developments are not appropriate (L’Etang, 2014); hence, there is a necessity to provide the space where public relations historians can be critical, reconceptualize paradigms, and become bolder in their analysis of the field. The scholarship of this niche area was offered a substantial platform for development in 2010 with the founding of the International History of Public Relations Conference (IHPRC) by Professor Tom Watson. Since then, expansion of research outputs published yearly in special issues, books, book chapters and the proceedings of the IHPRC is evident. Over the past 7 years, the IHPRC has provided the opportunity for more than 280 papers to be presented and discussed from Asian, Eastern European, Middle Eastern, African, South American, Western European, and North American regions. The papers could be classified under the Watson (2013) typology in those describing and analysing narratives of the past, investigating historical cases, and offering an alternative approach. The latter typology offers a thematic breakdown involving themes on national public relations histories, influential personalities, cases/campaigns that were affected (even unintentionally) by public relations, and finally those that offer future historiographic directions. This special issue hosts research outputs presented during the seventh IHPRC, held at Bournemouth University in July 2016, as well as the work of other public relations historians who responded to the call for manuscripts. The four articles, in alphabetical order, are the following: William B. Anderson, using the American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA) as a case study in his article “Social movements and public relations in the early twentieth century: How one group used public relations to curtail venereal disease rates,” introduces some antecedents of contemporary public relations. Public relations is examined in relation to social movements and how ASHA members used persuasive communication via audience segmentation, events, visual media, and the creation of house organs to get their messages across. Public relations and public relations-like activities are highlighted in ASHA’s campaign to make sexual health an issue for the public in the early 20th century. Natalia Rodríguez-Salcedo and Beatriz Gómez-Baceiredo in “A herstory of public relations: Teresa Dorn, from Scott Cutlip to Burson-Marsteller Europe (1974–1995)” explore the developments of a world-renowned consultancy under the influential leadership of Teresa Dorn in the newly established democracy of Spain. Through oral and archival history, the authors offer insight on the difficulties and prejudices that a female practitioner of the time had to face while guiding Burson-Masteller to become one of Spain’s top consultancies. Cylor Spaulding and Melanie Formentin explore the advancement of Scientology as a church denomination to evaluate the role of public relations in this religious movement. The authors’ article, “Building a religious brand: Exploring the foundations of the Church of Scientology through public relations,” provides evidence that allows the evaluation of founder L. Ron Hubbard’s use of public relations to establish the Church of Scientology. Finally, Gareth Thompson’s “Parallels in propaganda? A comparative historical analysis of Islamic State and the Nazi Party” draws a comparative historical analysis between the so-called Islamic State (IS) and the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nazi Party) by applying historical institutionalism and interdiscursive analysis based on communication artefacts from both organizations. While comparing the propaganda operations between the two organizations, the author confirms parallels in 10 categorizations and places into perspective the effectiveness of digital recruitment for IS. Thompson’s findings place IS propaganda in historical context and provide insight on countermeasure communication strategies when considering the youth as a target audience of organizations such as IS. All four articles enrich the literature on public relations history, proving that knowledge creation produced from historical research is valuable for practitioners, researchers, tutors, or students of the discipline. Public relations doesn’t exist in a silo and has a rich history that needs to be told accurately and interpretatively.",academic_research,"Editor’s essayHistorical research within public relations is a relatively new field of scholarship.

Over the past 7 years, the IHPRC has provided the opportunity for more than 280 papers to be presented and discussed from Asian, Eastern European, Middle Eastern, African, South American, Western European, and North American regions. The papers could be classified under the Watson (2013) typology in those describing and analysing narratives of the past, investigating historical cases, and offering an alternative approach. The latter typology offers a thematic breakdown involving themes on national public relations histories, influential personalities, cases/campaigns that were affected (even unintentionally) by public relations, and finally those that offer future historiographic directions. This special issue hosts research outputs presented during the seventh IHPRC, held at Bournemouth University in July 2016, as well as the work of other public relations historians who responded to the call for manuscripts. The four articles, in alphabetical order, are the following: William B. Anderson, using the American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA) as a case study in his article “Social movements and public relations in the early twentieth century: How one group used public relations to curtail venereal disease rates,” introduces some antecedents of contemporary public relations. Public relations is examined in relation to social movements and how ASHA members used persuasive communication via audience segmentation, events, visual media, and the creation of house organs to get their messages across. Public relations and public relations-like activities are highlighted in ASHA’s campaign to make sexual health an issue for the public in the early 20th century. Natalia Rodríguez-Salcedo and Beatriz Gómez-Baceiredo in “A herstory of public relations: Teresa Dorn, from Scott Cutlip to Burson-Marsteller Europe (1974–1995)” explore the developments of a world-renowned consultancy under the influential leadership of Teresa Dorn in the newly established democracy of Spain. Through oral and archival history, the authors offer insight on the difficulties and prejudices that a female practitioner of the time had to face while guiding Burson-Masteller to become one of Spain’s top consultancies. Cylor Spaulding and Melanie Formentin explore the advancement of Scientology as a church denomination to evaluate the role of public relations in this religious movement. The authors’ article, “Building a religious brand: Exploring the foundations of the Church of Scientology through public relations,” provides evidence that allows the evaluation of founder L. Ron Hubbard’s use of public relations to establish the Church of Scientology. Finally, Gareth Thompson’s “Parallels in propaganda? A comparative historical analysis of Islamic State and the Nazi Party” draws a comparative historical analysis between the so-called Islamic State (IS) and the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nazi Party) by applying historical institutionalism and interdiscursive analysis based on communication artefacts from both organizations. While comparing the propaganda operations between the two organizations, the author confirms parallels in 10 categorizations and places into perspective the effectiveness of digital recruitment for IS. Thompson’s findings place IS propaganda in historical context and provide insight on countermeasure communication strategies when considering the youth as a target audience of organizations such as IS. All four articles enrich the literature on public relations history, proving that knowledge creation produced from historical research is valuable for practitioners, researchers, tutors, or students of the discipline. Public relations doesn’t exist in a silo and has a rich history that needs to be told accurately and interpretatively."
2017,1,William B. Anderson,Social movements and public relations in the early twentieth century: How one group used public relations to curtail venereal disease rates,"A case study of the American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA) campaign to craft a national vision for social health showed that the group used public relations-like strategies to, as one of their officials said, “crystallize public opinion” years before Edward Bernays wrote a book of the same title. Although these efforts might not have been labeled public relations at the time, this study introduces some precedents of contemporary public relations. In this study, social activism offered a more robust approach to addressing an issue than using media relations alone could do. ASHA members used communication strategies such as segmenting audiences, utilizing events to reach appropriate audiences, using visual media, and creating house organs to arouse public sentiment, influence attitudes, and promote desired behavior. This case study expands public relations history theory by examining why ASHA members practiced public relations as they did. In this case, ASHA used persuasive communication to pierce the veil of silence around venereal disease to craft a national vision for social hygiene and legitimize the group as the major voice on this topic. Lessons from this case can illustrate how public relations can be conducted more effectively, especially in relation to social movements.",academic_research,"Social movements and public relations in the early twentieth century: How one group used public relations to curtail venereal disease ratesA case study of the American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA) campaign to craft a national vision for social health showed that the group used public relations-like strategies to, as one of their officials said, “crystallize public opinion” years before Edward Bernays wrote a book of the same title.

This comparative historical approach aims to reduce the uncertainty associated with extremist terrorism and bring a historic-communicative perspective to an organization that politicians and commentators arguably overestimate in what has been described as the “epistemological crisis” of Western counterterrorism. This investigation attempts a methodological expansion of public relations historiography by applying the theoretical approach of historical institutionalism as basis for comparison between the two institutions alongside conventional content and artefact analysis.

2017,2&3,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay: Change and resistance,"As a doctoral student two decades ago, I was rooting around a library at the University of Maryland looking for different ways to think about “symmetry,” because something about the original notion of public relations being practiced in a “two-way symmetrical model” (see Grunig & Hunt, 1984) felt “off” to me, like it had to many others (e.g., Leichty, 1997; Murphy, 1991). In that library, I stumbled across research by Emmy Noether (1882–1935), whose mathematical equations proved “that symmetry—or change—can only exist simultaneously with conservation or invariance” (Sha, 2004, p. 391). These equations came to be known as “Noether’s Theorem” (Alekseevskii, 1988; Byers, 1999; Ne’Eman, 1999; Noether, 1987). But what struck me even more than Noether’s mathematical brilliance was her persistence in demonstrating it continually against the rigid resistance (and outright discrimination) she faced as she did her work, simply because she was female and Jewish (see Byers, 1999; Noether, 1987). As I have asserted before, the implication of Noether’s Theorem for public relations (at least to me) was that “an organization can behave “symmetrically” while maintaining certain beliefs, principles, or purposes that will never be relinquished” (Sha, 2004, p. 391). And just as the duality of symmetry and conservation resonated with me decades ago, the duality of change and resistance is something that I think about constantly today. Perhaps my pre-occupation with change and resistance is because both phenomena seem to permeate our quotidian existence in ways more visible, more concerning, and more outrageous than in recent history. And I’m not just talking about the political landscape. Change Even in editing this journal, I feel constantly the pressures of both change and resistance. And to be honest, some days, I can’t tell which side I’m on. On the side of change, I often feel that editing an academic journal can be transformative: Learning about new research being done around the world. Mentoring younger scholars in the publication process. Encouraging innovative ideas and new scholarship. Pushing the boundaries of theory in public relations. Resistance But at other times, I feel that academic journal editing is a last bastion of the resistance: Fighting against the rush to decision-making, by taking time to think through difficult editorial decisions. Resisting the emphasis on publication quantity that seems to be the current bureaucratic yardstick for measuring “good research,” no matter its scholarly rigor or provocative insight. Insisting on the importance of scientific endeavor, in a time when some societal forces would have us believe that objective evidence can be ignored because “if there’s a real problem, [God] can take care of it” (see DeMarche, 2017; Jagannathan, 2017; Rozsa, 2017). Co-existence One is tempted to suggest, with no small amount of sarcasm, that perhaps God is “taking care of it” by sending His messengers in the form of scientists and His message in the form of scientific data. After all, God and science can co-exist. Similarly, change and resistance are not opposite ends of a spectrum; they can and do co-exist, both in concept and in our real lives. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1936) claimed that “the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function” (n.p.). And so, journal editors soldier on, trying to function, in the midst of change and resistance. Employee communication, job engagement, and organizational commitment: A study of members of the Millennial Generation The article by Justin Walden, Eun Wha Jung and Catherine Y. K. Westerman advances public relations theory in employee-organization relationships (EORs) by delimiting its conceptual focus to job engagement (as distinct from “organizational engagement” or “organizational commitment”) and by positing job engagement as a mediator between employee communication and organizational commitment. The authors define job engagement “as a positive and fulfilling state of mind characterized by dedication, vigor, and absorption at work” (p. 73), a state influenced by organizational communication in terms of information adequacy, information flow, and interaction supportiveness. Together, these latter three concepts form the operationalization of “employee communication” in this study. In addition to its contributions to public relations theory, the article advances research by focusing on Millennials as a situational public, i.e., one whose members are presently “in the first third of their career” (p. 85), a situation that obviously will change over time. I believe this approach to be much more useful in the long term than the plethora of hand-wringing articles in both trade and academic literature that treats Millennials as a cross-situational public, i.e., one defined by birth year and thus doomed to reflect narcissism, entitlement, and self-centeredness (for one example, see Twenge, 2006). This article also includes an appendix item that explains why the authors did not include any demographic variables in running their SEM analysis. This explanation was originally offered by the authors in their response to a reviewer question, and I hope that including it here enhances reader understanding of both an advanced statistical analysis method and the process of revising manuscripts for journal publication. Dialogues with entrepreneurs in China: How start-up companies cultivate relationships with strategic publics The article by Linjuan Rita Men, Yi Grace Ji, and Zifei Fay Chen advances our knowledge in public relations management by integrating prior research on start-up with existing scholarship on organization-public relationships. The piece articulates a clear definition for start-ups as “small- to medium-sized enterprises in an early stage of development that focus on providing high-tech innovative products and services” (p. 91) and breaks new scholarly ground by investigating the role of public relations in start-ups’ efforts to cultivate relationships in the context of a competitive, fast-growing market (i.e., China). Interestingly, although the entrepreneurs interviewed noted the role of public relations in building relationships with organizational stakeholders, the term “relationship building” was noticeably absent from their explicit definitions of the term “public relations.” Future scholars may learn from the authors’ clear articulation of their procedures for data collection, reduction and analysis, as well as from their reflection on how their personal and professional backgrounds may have affected the execution of those procedures. Exploring trust and distrust as conceptually and empirically distinct constructs: Association with symmetrical communication and public engagement across four pairings of trust and distrust Minjeong Kang and Young Eun Park tease out conceptual and operational distinctions between trust and distrust, which prior literature has tended to treat as opposing ends of a single spectrum. This study breaks new theoretical ground in finding empirical support for the validity of treating trust and distrust as separate dimensions, which opens up the possibility of both conditions existing simultaneously in organization-public relationships. In addition, the study examines how four types of trust-distrust pairings are related to two important concepts in public relations research (i.e., symmetrical communication and public engagement), finding that “the high trust-high distrust pairing consistently showed the strongest, positive association,” (p. 131) compared to other pairing types. This most interesting finding augurs well for the future of public relations scholarship on the concepts of trust and distrust treated as separate dimensions. For example, the measures used in this study for trust and distrust can be applied to different organization types, industries, and contexts. Even more helpful for pushing forward the body of knowledge in public relations, this study underscores that future research on organization-public relationships should investigate further the concept of “distrust,” while carefully avoiding the temptation to equate this concept with “lack of trust” or “low trust.” More broadly, this article underscores that all researchers should explicate carefully the concepts used in their studies.",academic_research,"Editor’s essay: Change and resistanceAs a doctoral student two decades ago, I was rooting around a library at the University of Maryland looking for different ways to think about “symmetry,” because something about the original notion of public relations being practiced in a “two-way symmetrical model” (see Grunig & Hunt, 1984) felt “off” to me, like it had to many others (e.g., Leichty, 1997; Murphy, 1991).

The results from the surveys (N = 704; in 20 companies) of US consumers showed sound discriminant validity of trust and distrust.

2017,4,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay: Relationship matters,"The notion that public relations is really about relationships dates back to one of the earliest textbooks in our field, when Cutlip and Center (1952) offered “the term, public relations, to describe the principles and practice of communications employed to build good relationships with the public” (p. 5, italics original). The centrality of “relationships” remains in the latest edition of Cutlip and Center’s Effective Public Relations, in which public relations is defined as “the management function that establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on whom its success or failure depends” (Broom & Sha, 2013, p. 2). Yet, not until Ferguson (1984) called for public relations researchers to put more effort into studying “relationships” did this concept begin to get serious scholarly attention. Today, “relationship management” is identified as a key area of scholarship in public relations (Sallot, Lyon, Acosta-Alzuru, & Jones, 2003), with researchers examining strategies for maintaining relationships, antecedents to relationships, and relationship outcomes, in numerous journal articles, book chapters, and edited texts. For some examples, see Broom, Casey, and Ritchey (1997); Bruning (2001); Ledingham and Bruning (2001); Ki, Kim, and Ledingham (2015); Hon and J. Grunig (1999); Huang (2001); Hung (2005); Ki and Hon (2007, 2009); Pressgrove and McKeever (2016); and Sweetser and Kelleher (2016). Despite the plethora of current scholarship on “relationships,” a key tension that remains unresolved in public relations research on relationships between organizations and their publics is that scholars often apply to these meso-level connections concepts and measurements designed for micro-level connections, i.e., interpersonal relationships (e.g., Stafford & Canary, 1991). Can relationships between organizations and publics be fully explained by theories about relationships between people? What exactly constitutes a “relationship”? Can a relationship exist without intentionality on the part of one party or the other? (For example, can an activist public have a “relationship” with an organization that wants nothing to do with it, much like a stalker’s “relationship” with his or her target?) Who authors intentionality in organization-public relationships? Do relationships with publics originate with organizational leadership, the public relations function, or a group of rogue employees? What if one part of an organization desires a relationship while another part of that same organization does not? Can organization-public relationships even be truly “managed” if the public relations function controls neither the publics nor the organization’s dominant coalition? I encourage our scholarly community to think critically about questions such as these, to consider the compositions of the complex entities involved in organization-public relationships, and—indeed—to problematize the very notion of “relationships” in public relations. As a maturing discipline, we now must move beyond the wholesale importing of interpersonal relationship theories and their simple application to organization-public relationships; such is the next frontier in public relations scholarship in the relationship management paradigm. Exploring public relations challenges in a compounding crisis: The pariah effect of toxic trailers This article by Shari R. Veil and Kathryn E. Anthony enhances public relations theory by offering “compounding crisis” as a crisis type that the authors carefully differentiate from the concepts “cascading crisis” (cf. Veil & Husted, 2012) and “double crisis” (cf. Johansen & Frandsen, 2007). The study also contributes to public relations theory by identifying and labeling a “pariah effect” that affects organizations’ willingness to associate (or to risk being perceived as associating) with a specific organization in crisis. Methodologically, the study offers an example of inductive analytic method, in which findings “emerged” from the case analysis. The authors used case evidence from interviews, government reports, Congressional testimony, and news articles to identify six themes reflecting challenges faced by the organization, as well as two meta-themes that encapsulate the study’s key implications. The key result of this research is evidence for the authors’ proposition that, “in a compounding crisis, organizational legitimacy and social capital decrease while stakeholder risk perceptions and attribution of crisis responsibility increase” (p. 145). Furthermore, the study reifies the importance of organizational action, in addition to organizational communication, in public relations (cf. Broom & Sha, 2013). When the relationships fail: A microperspective on consumer responses to service failure Examining service failure as a distinct type of organizational crisis, Zongchao Cathy Li and Don Stacks consider how dissatisfied consumers may become activist “micro-publics,” answering the call from Bardhan (2011) and others to consider how an individual-level phenomenon may build eventually into societal-level concerns (cf. Ihlen & van Ruler, 2009; Toth, 2000). The study applies the exit-voice-revenge framework (see Huefner & Hunt, 2000; Huefner et al., 2002) to a public relations problem, with one key finding being the apparent blurring of these response categories in the social media age. Given the current social media environment in which organizations must operate, this article thus offers a valuable distinction between online and offline revenge behaviors. In addition, the authors offer a detailed explanation of both their procedures for structural equation modeling (SEM) and their SEM analysis decisions. This article demonstrates the appropriate use of SEM to test relationships among concepts, and the authors model a thoughtful discussion of possible reasons for SEM results of nonsignificance (e.g., lack of statistical power, poor operationalization). Such scholarly reflection is valuable not only to readers of this journal, but also to members of the broader academic community, as we all strive to raise the caliber of academic research in general. Motivation with misinformation: conceptualizing lacuna individuals and publics as knowledge-deficient, issue-negative activists The study by Arunima Krishna moves forward public relations theories on the activation of organizational publics by examining a specific type of individual activist, someone who lacks (scientifically accurate) knowledge about an issue, and yet feels both negatively about that issue and strongly motivated to do something about it. The article advances our theoretical understanding of activist publics, and the incorporation of the data-information-knowledge-wisdom framework (DIWK; see Ackoff, 1989) from information sciences demonstrates the theoretical power of incorporating concepts from fields outside public relations. Methodologically, the author’s use of the summation method, as well as her thorough description of its execution, helps facilitate future scholarship using the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) and the situational theory of publics (STP), as most research on the latter originally employed canonical correlation to identify publics arising around issues in a specific situation set (see, for example, historical work cited in J. Grunig, 1997). Furthermore, the disaggregated analysis of results related to constraint recognition, as explained on page 187, suggests that future research into this construct would be very interesting both theoretically and operationally.",academic_research,"Editor’s essay: Relationship mattersThe notion that public relations is really about relationships dates back to one of the earliest textbooks in our field, when Cutlip and Center (1952) offered “the term, public relations, to describe the principles and practice of communications employed to build good relationships with the public” (p. 5, italics original). The centrality of “relationships” remains in the latest edition of Cutlip and Center’s Effective Public Relations, in which public relations is defined as “the management function that establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on whom its success or failure depends” (Broom & Sha, 2013, p. 2). Yet, not until Ferguson (1984) called for public relations researchers to put more effort into studying “relationships” did this concept begin to get serious scholarly attention. Today, “relationship management” is identified as a key area of scholarship in public relations (Sallot, Lyon, Acosta-Alzuru, & Jones, 2003), with researchers examining strategies for maintaining relationships, antecedents to relationships, and relationship outcomes, in numerous journal articles, book chapters, and edited texts. For some examples, see Broom, Casey, and Ritchey (1997); Bruning (2001); Ledingham and Bruning (2001); Ki, Kim, and Ledingham (2015); Hon and J. Grunig (1999); Huang (2001); Hung (2005); Ki and Hon (2007, 2009); Pressgrove and McKeever (2016); and Sweetser and Kelleher (2016). Despite the plethora of current scholarship on “relationships,” a key tension that remains unresolved in public relations research on relationships between organizations and their publics is that scholars often apply to these meso-level connections concepts and measurements designed for micro-level connections, i.e., interpersonal relationships (e.g., Stafford & Canary, 1991). Can relationships between organizations and publics be fully explained by theories about relationships between people? What exactly constitutes a “relationship”? Can a relationship exist without intentionality on the part of one party or the other? (For example, can an activist public have a “relationship” with an organization that wants nothing to do with it, much like a stalker’s “relationship” with his or her target?) Who authors intentionality in organization-public relationships? Do relationships with publics originate with organizational leadership, the public relations function, or a group of rogue employees? What if one part of an organization desires a relationship while another part of that same organization does not? Can organization-public relationships even be truly “managed” if the public relations function controls neither the publics nor the organization’s dominant coalition? I encourage our scholarly community to think critically about questions such as these, to consider the compositions of the complex entities involved in organization-public relationships, and—indeed—to problematize the very notion of “relationships” in public relations. As a maturing discipline, we now must move beyond the wholesale importing of interpersonal relationship theories and their simple application to organization-public relationships; such is the next frontier in public relations scholarship in the relationship management paradigm. Exploring public relations challenges in a compounding crisis: The pariah effect of toxic trailers This article by Shari R. Veil and Kathryn E. Anthony enhances public relations theory by offering “compounding crisis” as a crisis type that the authors carefully differentiate from the concepts “cascading crisis” (cf. Veil & Husted, 2012) and “double crisis” (cf. Johansen & Frandsen, 2007). The study also contributes to public relations theory by identifying and labeling a “pariah effect” that affects organizations’ willingness to associate (or to risk being perceived as associating) with a specific organization in crisis. Methodologically, the study offers an example of inductive analytic method, in which findings “emerged” from the case analysis. The authors used case evidence from interviews, government reports, Congressional testimony, and news articles to identify six themes reflecting challenges faced by the organization, as well as two meta-themes that encapsulate the study’s key implications. The key result of this research is evidence for the authors’ proposition that, “in a compounding crisis, organizational legitimacy and social capital decrease while stakeholder risk perceptions and attribution of crisis responsibility increase” (p. 145).

2017,4,Shari R. Veil & Kathryn E. Anthony,Exploring public relations challenges in compounding crises: The pariah effect of toxic trailers,"This study examined the distinct exigency of a compounding crisis, a crisis that occurs in close succession to another (potentially unrelated) crisis before an organization has had the opportunity to rebuild legitimacy. Specifically, we identified the public relations challenges faced by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency during the formaldehyde travel trailer crisis and examined how the Hurricane Katrina crisis encumbered the agency’s response efforts. We offer a theoretical frame for understanding the public relations challenges inherent in compounding crises and propose that, in a compounding crisis, organizational legitimacy and social capital decrease while stakeholder risk perceptions and attribution of crisis responsibility increase. A new phenomenon termed the pariah effect is offered to explain when an organization experiencing a compounding crisis is ostracized by other organizations that could assist with the crisis response to avoid negative spillover effects that could result from associating with the offending organization. This study also demonstrates how attribution of responsibility in a compounding crisis can create an exigency in which an organization must take actions beyond the scope and original mission of the organization.",academic_research,"Exploring public relations challenges in compounding crises: The pariah effect of toxic trailersThis study examined the distinct exigency of a compounding crisis, a crisis that occurs in close succession to another (potentially unrelated) crisis before an organization has had the opportunity to rebuild legitimacy.

2017,5,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s Essay: Political Tolerance Versus Tolerant Politics,"To be honest, I worry a lot about public relations, and I worry a lot about politics. And frankly, editing this special issue on political public relations has done little to assuage my worries. Let me explain. The Merriam-Webster dictionary (2017) offers one definition of politics as “competition between competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership” (n.p.). The implication of this definition is that politics is a zero-sum game, wherein one party wins at the expense of the other party. In perhaps the most obvious example, only one winner can emerge in any electoral contest; the other candidates are by definition losers. Strömbäck and Kiousis (2011) have defined political public relations as: the management process by which an organization or individual for political purposes, through purposeful communication and action, seeks to influence and to establish, build, and maintain beneficial relationships and reputations with its key publics to help support its mission and achieve its goals. (p. 8; emphasis added) The politics of public relations What troubles me about both of these definitions (however realistic and pragmatic they may be) is that neither supports the (perhaps idealized) notion of public relations as being inherently symmetrical in nature (cf. J. Grunig, 1992), seeking to build mutually beneficial relationships (cf. Broom & Sha, 2013; Cutlip & Center, 1952), in a “win-win zone” (cf. Dozier, Grunig, & Grunig, 1995). What worries me about political public relations, then, is the question of whose mission and whose goals will be served by our efforts. Historically, we know that Edward Bernays (1965) ran a successful campaign to encourage women to smoke cigarettes (seen in the 1930s as an assertion of feminist independence, not an invitation to lung cancer). With help from Atlanta publicists Edward Young Clarke and Elizabeth Tyler, membership in the White supremacist Ku Klux Klan went from “only a few thousand” in 1920 to “nearly 100,000” just one year later (Baudouin, 2011, p. 17). At the time of his death in 1934, public relations pioneer Ivy Ledbetter Lee was under fire for his connections to a German company affiliated with the Nazi government (Hiebert, 1966). More recently, the efforts of public relations firm Hill & Knowlton on behalf of Citizens for a Free Kuwait led to US Congressional support for the Persian Gulf War (Lee, 1990). As these examples show, the historical record of our discipline demonstrates that what we now call political public relations has long (if not always) been part of our profession, despite the contemporary, idealized definition of public relations. Indeed, Guth and Marsh (2003) noted that “some historians believe that the development of public relations is a direct result of Western civilization’s first true democracy: the city-state of Athens led by Pericles from 461 to 429 B.C.” (p. 57). Although the definitive resource on public relations history remains Cutlip (1994, 1995), the history chapters of textbooks in our field typically trace the development of public relations-like activities from ancient democracies and the growth of the Roman Catholic Church (which functioned in many respects as its own nation-state) through the American Revolution and subsequent Civil War. (For examples, see chapter 2 in Grunig & Hunt, 1984; chapter 3 in Guth & Marsh, 2003; chapter 4 in Broom & Sha, 2013; chapter 2 in Wilcox, Cameron, & Reber, 2015). In short, the history of public relations has always been political. The marketplace of ideas Several textbooks also note the connection between public relations (historical or current; political or otherwise) and rhetorical traditions, which include public communications designed specifically to persuade (for examples, see chapter 4 in Crable & Vibbert, 1986; chapter 1 in Heath & Coombs, 2006). Along these lines, some have argued that all parties deserve public relations advocacy in the court of public opinion, much like all defendants deserve representation in the court of law (e.g., Fitzpatrick, 2006; see also Heath, 2000). The Public Relations Society of America specifically stated that practitioners “serve the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for those we represent … [and] provide a voice in the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate” (Public Relations Society of America, 2017). Yet, if public relations is truly about both actions and words (e.g., The Page Principles, 2017), an ethical and professional public relations counselor would not only help the client determine what to say, but also recommend corrective actions internal to the organization. Nevertheless, this only works in cases where the mission of the organization is amenable to change. In cases where the very existence of the organization depends on its mission, that mission may always be conserved or maintained (Sha, 2004). For example, no amount of public relations counsel regarding organizational words and actions is likely to result in a prochoice or a prolife organization yielding ground on its fundamental purpose to defend its respective position. How, then, might public relations professionals determine which ideas in the marketplace merit defending more or less than other ideas? The paradox of tolerance I believe that one answer to this challenging question lies in Popper’s (1945) Paradox of Tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. … We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal. (p. 226) Viewed in Popper’s light, the question of which ideas in the marketplace merit defending by public relations becomes the question of whether public relations should defend criminality or promote intolerance. Unlike in the court of law, criminals are not entitled to defense in the court of public opinion. Under this scenario, and given the win-lose definition of political public relations, the losers would be those organizations, people, and viewpoints for which public relations practitioners refuse to work. And the ultimate winner would be our collective civil society that tolerates a greater diversity of viewpoints or that encourages, as Taylor (2013) explained, “an orientation to others that enables collective action that creates a common good” (p. 122). Credibility or credulity? Examining political organization-public relationships in an election of interloping candidates Kaye Sweetser and Nicholas Browning examine the political success of candidates they define as interlopers or intruders in a space or activity, with the key finding that respondents’ dissatisfaction with their own political party did NOT drive support for interloping candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Using Kelleher’s (2009) definition of communicated commitment as “communication in which members of an organization work to express their commitment to building and maintaining a relationship” (p. 176), Sweetser and Browning found that communicated commitment was related to higher satisfaction perceived by voters with both their own political party and the opposing party. Furthermore, as the authors note on page 213, “Across the board, individuals appear satisfied with their relationship with the Democratic Party and dissatisfied with their relationship with the Republican Party, regardless of party affiliation.” Studying relationships between a voter and his/her own political party makes sense, from the political party’s strategic standpoint of trying to increase proparty identification or to encourage proparty voting behaviors. Yet, of broader significance for society is studying relationships between a voter and the opposing political party, as election winners in democratic systems are supposed to govern for the good of all regardless of party affiliation, not merely to govern for the good of their own partisan affiliates and interests. This study underscores the complex interplay of relationships (measured as communicated commitment and conversational voice), credibility (including trust), and political information efficacy. What’s not to like? a qualitative study of young women politicians’ self-framing on twitter Politics is gendered (cf. Celis, Kantola, Waylen, & Weldon, 2016); gender is political and politicized (de Beauvoir, 1953/1989). For example, much has been made elsewhere regarding the 2016 US presidential election in which a man with no prior experience in political office won an electoral victory over a woman described as the “most qualified presidential candidate in history” (Reuters, 2016, n.p.). And really, that entire electoral spectacle reminded me that “No one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or scornful, than the man who is anxious about his virility” (de Beauvoir, 1953/1989, p. xxxi). But, what about electoral contests in which gender may not be a variable, simply because both candidates are of the same gender? Does gender still matter then? Apparently, yes. In her study of how two women candidates for New Zealand’s parliament used Twitter to promote both their own electoral campaigns and their respective party’s political platforms, Susan Fontaine investigates the gendered dimensions of social media use. Her analysis furthers our conceptual and practical understanding of the equalization theory of social media (see Vergeer, 2015), i.e., the notion that social media platforms have leveled the playing field for diverse groups of political actors. The study’s implication for public relations theory—indeed, for any social science discipline’s theory-building efforts—is that gendered dimensions of scholarship and practice cannot be ignored. Agenda-building role of state-owned media around the world: 2014 hongkong protest case The article by Tianduo Zhang, Ji Young Kim, Tiffany Mohr, Barbara Myslik, Liudmila Khalitova, Guy Golan, and Spiro Kiousis explicitly articulates the conceptual connection between public relations and public diplomacy by connecting public relations scholarship on agenda setting and agenda building to a wider research stream on intermedia agenda-building efforts, which are important for public diplomacy purposes. This study’s findings point to the importance of dyadic government relationships for intermedia agenda-building, and they contradict previous research (e.g., Sheafer, Shenhav, Takens, & van Atteveldt, 2014) regarding the impact of state-level homophily on the three levels of agenda building. This study advances public relations theory by distinguishing conceptually between intermedia agenda building and intermedia agenda setting, by conceptualizing state-owned media as an information subsidy, and by empirically testing the impact on agenda building of variables from international and intercultural relations. The latter include the homophily-related variables of culture, democracy, and press freedom, as well as the relationship-history variables of diplomatic ties and historical militarized dispute. I believe future scholars will appreciate the article’s transparency of method, with detailed information on coding criteria and content analysis procedures. And I hope the study’s focus on state-owned Chinese media helps to reduce the ethnocentrism often found in US-based academic journals, in which the United States is the central lens through which scholarly phenomena are viewed, which is in and of itself a problem of academic politics.",academic_research,"Editor’s Essay: Political Tolerance Versus Tolerant PoliticsTo be honest, I worry a lot about public relations, and I worry a lot about politics.

The study’s implication for public relations theory—indeed, for any social science discipline’s theory-building efforts—is that gendered dimensions of scholarship and practice cannot be ignored. Agenda-building role of state-owned media around the world: 2014 hongkong protest case The article by Tianduo Zhang, Ji Young Kim, Tiffany Mohr, Barbara Myslik, Liudmila Khalitova, Guy Golan, and Spiro Kiousis explicitly articulates the conceptual connection between public relations and public diplomacy by connecting public relations scholarship on agenda setting and agenda building to a wider research stream on intermedia agenda-building efforts, which are important for public diplomacy purposes. This study’s findings point to the importance of dyadic government relationships for intermedia agenda-building, and they contradict previous research (e.g., Sheafer, Shenhav, Takens, & van Atteveldt, 2014) regarding the impact of state-level homophily on the three levels of agenda building. This study advances public relations theory by distinguishing conceptually between intermedia agenda building and intermedia agenda setting, by conceptualizing state-owned media as an information subsidy, and by empirically testing the impact on agenda building of variables from international and intercultural relations. The latter include the homophily-related variables of culture, democracy, and press freedom, as well as the relationship-history variables of diplomatic ties and historical militarized dispute. I believe future scholars will appreciate the article’s transparency of method, with detailed information on coding criteria and content analysis procedures. And I hope the study’s focus on state-owned Chinese media helps to reduce the ethnocentrism often found in US-based academic journals, in which the United States is the central lens through which scholarly phenomena are viewed, which is in and of itself a problem of academic politics."

2017,6,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay: Language in research,"Public relations is a management function (see Broom & Sha, 2013; Grunig, 1992; van Ruler & Verčič, 2002). As a management function, public relations reflects perhaps the English-language dominance that has been documented in international management (see Tietze, 2008). As one example, Radanovich (2014) found English language (both spoken and written) to be a barrier to entry to the profession for some Hispanic practitioners in the United States. As another example, van Ruler And Verčič (2002) lamented the US-centric teaching of public relations in Europe, an artifact at the time of academic reliance on US-created (and hence, English-language) public relations textbooks. “Englishization”: Positive and negative Dor (2004) noted the tension between what he termed “Englishization” in the process of economic globalization and the presumed corresponding loss in local languages. In their review of the “literature on linguistic globalization” (p. 271), Steyaert, Ostendorp, and Gaibrois (2011) found three perspectives on this phenomenon: positive, negative, and neutral. The first perspective sees English-language dominance in global business as a positive force that facilitates more-efficient communications and operations. In contrast, the second perspective criticizes English-language dominance as a form of linguistic imperialism that may lead to cultural and ideological imperialism. The third perspective is “ambivalent,” and it “instigates us to research the multiple and often contradictory effects of Englishization as people come to terms with the complexity of multilingualism in everyday interaction and negotiation” (Steyaert et al., 2011, p. 271). In the spirit of this third approach, as it may be seen to pertain to the Englishization of public relations scholarship, I offer in this article some thoughts for authors doing research in a non-English language who seek to publish their work in this English-language journal. Language: Signifier and signified Language is but the representation of a mental image, with Saussure (1916/1983) asserting that spoken words are signifiers of concepts (i.e., the signified) and that both signifier and signified are inextricably linked to each other; together, the signifier and the signified form a linguistic sign (Saussure, 1916/1983). From an applied research standpoint, the notion of signifiers and their signified imply at least three challenges: First, researchers are relying on the ability of study participants to express their own mental concepts through language. This is particularly a challenge for scholars using qualitative methods, often for the very purpose of being able to privilege the voices of research participants (see, for example, Marshall & Rossman, 2011). Second, researchers must then convey the information collected from study participants about their perceptions of a given empirical phenomenon. This conveyance of quantitative data typically involves statistics, but the conveyance of qualitative data might take a variety of forms (for details, see Miles & Huberman, 1994; and Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014). But research findings alone do not typically a journal article make. Thus, third, researchers must use the scholarly language of an academic article to convey theoretical concepts, which is where the problem of Englishization comes in. Can the English language fully signify mental concepts that exist in non-English-language-based cultures? I doubt it. If we rely strictly on the English language for academic publications in public relations, are we going to miss important signifieds and their signifiers? I am certain of it. Mitigation: In manuscripts and in the discipline Pragmatically, these challenges might be mitigated in a variety of ways, both in individual manuscripts and in the public relations field as a whole. First, I recommend the transparent disclosure of the language(s) used in data collection. Where English-language concepts are studied with non-English-using research participants, scholars should explain not only the language of data collection, but also the translation of research instruments and of in-language raw data. Who did the translations and what were their qualifications for doing so? What quality-control measures (e.g., back-translations) were undertaken to ensure that the translations were both accurate and meaningful? Second, I welcome the honest sharing of translation challenges in the method section of manuscripts. For example, van Ruler and Verčič (2002) discussed how the English-language term public relations means “relations with the public” in Germanic and Slavonic languages … except that the very term public has a variety of meanings in those languages that do not equate with the term public in English (pp. 3–4). These linguistic nuances should be explored, perhaps by multilingual research teams. Next, over time, I encourage the integration of non-English-language scholarly literature into English-language academic work. Honestly, I have been harping on this stuff for 2 decades: We must strive to integrate local scholarship, including research items developed in the local language. There may be theoretical concepts that English-speakers have not developed simply because we lack the language to articulate them. By incorporating local research into our own, we reduce our reliance on English as the starting and ending points of research—a reliance that limits our knowledge by imposing linguistic boundaries. In addition, cross-cultural scholarship … raises epistemological issues of translation by questioning whether realities studied and understood in one language ever can be recounted sufficiently in another. (Sha, 1999, p. 426) Last, I support the systematic development of non-English-language vocabulary relevant to public relations research and practice. For one example, see the work of Logar Berginc and Verčič (2013) to develop a repository of public relations terminology in Slovenian. Such efforts will become increasingly important to our field as, according to Dor (2004), the increased multilingualism on the Internet “actually works directly against the process of global Englishization by increasing the chances of many languages to survive” (p. 115). Now, on to an overview of this issue’s articles that survived the Journal’s rigorous review process: Elaborating the halo effect of SCCT: How and why performance history affects crisis responsibility and organizational reputation The situational crisis communication theory (SCCT, see Coombs, 2007) has been widely applied in public relations scholarship, but not all research grounded in SCCT has helped that theory to develop further, despite the plethora of publications citing Coombs’ work. This article by Jarim Kim offers an important theoretical contribution by elucidating how and why performance history, including crisis history and prior relational reputation, affects people’s perceptions regarding crisis responsibility and the reputation of an organization in crisis. In short, the study uses qualitative interviews to probe how a company’s performance history has contributed to a “halo effect” that essentially enables its stakeholders to doubt negative aspects of an organizational crisis and to attribute the crisis to an understandable and isolated “one-time mistake” (p. 285). The study also sheds light on why the halo effect works, essentially because of participants’ feelings of personal connection to and trust in the company. In addition to expanding theoretical understanding of the halo effect in crisis communication, this article demonstrates a key strength of qualitative research, to investigate the how and the why of empirical phenomena through the lived experiences of humans in their natural environments, as opposed to the contrived environment of a lab experiment. Also related to method, the article demonstrates appropriate disclosure regarding the languages used in data collection and analysis, as well as contextual background on South Korean businesses. Testing an environmental framework for understanding public relations practitioners’ orientation toward relationship management In another non-US-based study, Seow Ting Lee and Amanda Kee provide empirical data on Singapore, an unusual country in that its levels of political and media freedom have not kept pace with the city-state’s level of economic growth. This study examines the empirical connections between political, economic, and media environments and public relations practitioners’ orientations toward relationship management. The findings have implications for the professionalization of public relations and the ultimate fulfillment of the function’s potential as a manager of mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics. Methodologically, for future scholars, the article collects empirical measures of political system (as perceived degree of democracy), economic system (as perceived levels of economic development and economic freedom), and media system (as perceived level of media freedom). Because political, economic and media systems constitute, in part, what Sriramesh and VerčIč (2003) called “a theoretical framework for global public relations research and practice” (p. 1), I believe that the clear operationalizations of these concepts offered in this article will facilitate future cross-national, comparative research. The bottom line in this study is that “perceived degree of democracy is the only significant predictor of [practitioner] orientation toward relationship management” (p. 269). To me, this finding offers both illumination and direction. If we as public relations scholars care about the continued professionalization of the field, and if we believe wholeheartedly that professional public relations practice must be grounded in the definition of “public relations” as relationship management, then we must support, in ways large and small, the strivings toward democracy made by individuals, organizations, and nations. In short, as these authors suggested, their “findings shape broader understanding of the societal role of public relations in contemporary society and contribute to its melioristic interpretations” (p. 271). I further note that the definition of meliorism is not merely that the world may become better, but that it may improve by human effort. Hello, public relations scholars, practitioners, and students! We are those humans; improving our profession and our world is our calling! Relationship cultivation in public diplomacy: A qualitative study of relational antecedents and cultivation strategies Leysan Khakimova Storie investigates the intersections of political public relations and public diplomacy, concentrating in particular on the process of relationship cultivation, which involves not only initiating relationships, but also nurturing positive relationships and recovering from negative relationships. Three key findings from this study were that “(a) relationships were driven by goals and organizational needs; (b) trust was a necessary component for public diplomacy relationship cultivation; and (c) competition was common among organizations” (p. 302). This research illustrates the benefits of careful qualitative scholarship, exploring extant concepts from organization-public relationships theory in the context of public diplomacy and yielding new theoretical insights. In particular, the study sheds light on the mechanism of third-party introductions in the implementation of networking as a relationship cultivation strategy, provides nuance to the concept of trust with its findings related to “sense of security,” and confirms the notion of time as a dimension of commitment, suggesting that the latter relational strategy is one not merely of affect or intention, but also of actual duration in real time. The author’s suggestions for future research are particularly interesting, in light of global issues related to both politics and public diplomacy: “Future research should also explore how other public diplomacy actors, such as multinational corporations and activist groups, cultivate relationships in the context of public diplomacy” (p. 307). I especially concur with the author that “future research should explore the antecedents, strategies, and especially outcomes of relationship termination and estrangement in public diplomacy” (p. 308).",academic_research,"Editor’s essay: Language in researchPublic relations is a management function (see Broom & Sha, 2013; Grunig, 1992; van Ruler & Verčič, 2002).

2018,1&2,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay: Thoughts on theory,"The primary purpose of the Journal of Public Relations Research, since its founding, has been to help create, test, refine, or expand theory in public relations. Since commencing my editorship of this journal (work year 2015, credit year 2016), I have come to the chagrined realization that our journal’s very purpose is misunderstood by some authors, reviewers, and readers, for whom the phrase “theory in public relations” may not be quite clear. What is theory? At the most basic level, a theory is an idea or an explanation about how things work. As such, theories might come from a variety of sources that tell us what we know; these methods of knowing originally were articulated as tenacity, authority, taste, and science (see Pierce, 1877), with the method of taste now referred to as the method of intuition (see Wimmer & Dominick, 2014). The point of scientific endeavors (including social scientific efforts, as might be found in public relations) is to offer a method of knowing that is grounded in being public, objective, empirical, systematic, cumulative, predictive, and self-correcting (cf. Wimmer & Dominick, 2014). According to Reynolds (2007), scientific theories exist in at least two forms: (a) a theory can be “a set of well-supported empirical generalizations or ‘laws,’ … referred to as the ‘set-of-laws’ form of theory” (p. 8), or (b) a theory can be “an interrelated set of definitions, axioms, and propositions … called the ‘axiomatic’ form of theory” (pp. 8–9). As explained by Wimmer and Dominick (2014), “[a] theory is a set of related propositions that presents a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relationships among concepts” (p. 12). Really, then, theories are only as useful as the explanations that they can offer. In fact, Babbie (2014) actually defined theory as “a systematic explanation for the observations that relate to a particular aspect of life” (p. 9). Stinchcombe (1968), perhaps, expressed it best when he wrote that “theory ought to create the capacity to invent explanations” (p. 3, italics original). Thus, this journal seeks to publish research that will not only explain public relations phenomena, but also engender the creation of new theories in public relations. How are theories built? Creating new theories and enhancing existing theories are nonlinear processes. The various texts in theory construction all point to the constant interplay between the abstract and the empirical, between the conceptualized and the observed (e.g., Chaffee, 1991; Reynolds, 2007; Stinchcombe, 1968). For specific guidance on building social scientific theories, see the helpful text by Shoemaker, Tankard, and Lasorsa (2004) that literally offers ten steps for building a theory, including specifying both theoretical definitions (step #5) and operational definitions (step #6) for all concepts. Thus, to fulfill its primary purpose of theory-building in public relations, this journal seeks to publish articles that include both kinds of definitions. Defining theoretical concepts requires careful “explication,” an iterative process described by Chaffee (1991) as “the thinking that relates theory with research” (pp. 4–5), by which he meant connecting abstract ideas with empirical observations. In public relations scholarship, Broom, Casey, and Ritchey (1997) began the process of explicating organization-public relationships and in that effort also provided an example of a portion of the explication process. What can budding theorists do? Let me be clear: No research method has a monopoly on theory-building, and this journal continues to welcome scholarship employing all methods of data collection and analysis. No group of scholars or school of thought has exclusive rights over theory building in public relations, and all of us must share the burden of elevating the standards of scholarly work in our field. So, here are some suggestions for those who would engage in the definitely difficult, but fantastically fun, process of theory-building: Create: Connect theoretical concepts that were previously unconnected. Public relations is interdisciplinary, and extant literature in our field draws on concepts from many others. But creative theory building is not necessarily dependent on expertise in another discipline. Rather, as Hage suggested in his Foreword to Shoemaker et al. (2004), creative thinking might simply be facilitated by opening oneself to a variety of information sources, people, and experiences. Test: Apply an existing theory to a new situation, industry, context, country, or language. Then, go further by coming back to the theory to discuss ways in which it worked or failed to work, as well as why or why not. Expand: Add layers of nuance and complexity to the theoretical concept being studied. Consider whether a concept might, in fact, be multidimensional and drill down into each of those dimensions. Refine: Take an existing concept and problematize it. Critique with purpose, to build up, not bring down. Also, manuscripts submitted for review with this journal should include a discussion of the implications of the study’s findings for building theory in public relations. Seriously. As Wirtz and Zimbres (2018) show in their analysis (granted, of a specifically delimited scope) presented in this issue, public relations scholars have more frequently provided practical implications than theoretical implications regarding their work. In other words, we have spent more time telling practitioners how to improve public relations practice than we have spent time telling ourselves how to enhance public relations theory. Ultimately, I still agree with Botan and Hazleton (2006), who argued that “we need to encourage the development of additional and different theories of public relations … [and] … we need to engage in frequent and public debates over the merits and weaknesses of all theories of public relations” (p. 9). After all, the defining characteristic of a scientific theory may be its falsifiability (cf. Popper, 1959). A systematic analysis of research applying ‘principles of dialogic communication’ to organizational web sites, blogs, and social media: Implications for theory and practice. John Wirtz and Thais Menezes Zimbres offer an overdue, systematic analysis of research in public relations that has sought to apply the principles of dialogic communication (cf. Kent & Taylor, 1998) to organizational web sites, blogs, and social media, i.e., what practitioners today would call an organization’s owned media channels. The authors trace the history of public relations scholarly thought on dialogic communication to Pearson (1989), and they articulate a “dialogic communication framework” as “the group of five dialogic communication principles presented in Kent and Taylor (1998)” (p. 6). Furthermore, the article parses out the distinction between dialogic communication and symmetrical communication, two related but distinct concepts that some scholars seem determined to continually conflate (Kent & Lane, 2017). Strengths of this article include its clear articulation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of publications analyzed, the authors’ thorough explanation of the processes by which the codebook and coding categories were developed and refined by the research team, and the detailed explanation of how the content analysis was executed. This methodological clarity and transparency has strong potential for helping future scholars using the content analysis method. The article also offers two important theoretical contributions: First, the authors offer a conceptual definition of dialogic communication as “interactions between organizations and publics that seek to create mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual benefits” (p. 26). Second, the article offers three recommendations for advancing a dialogic theory of public relations: connecting to a larger community of dialogic theorists, reconsidering assumptions about organizational power and equality, and incorporating other forms of communication. Furthermore, Wirtz and Zimbres articulate an important implication of their study’s findings: “studying dialogue or studying some other communication phenomenon” (p. 23) is a scholarly choice. As researchers, we all make choices about where to expend our intellectual capacity and our scholarly energy; as editor-in-chief of this journal, I encourage researchers to choose endeavors that will push the boundaries of theoretical knowledge in public relations. To that end, and in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the publication of Kent and Taylor’s (1998) foundational article on the principles of dialogic communication, the Journal of Public Relations Research will publish, later this year, a special issue on digital dialogic theory, offering scholars the choice to further expand theory in this area into the current digital age. Walking the talk: An exploratory examination of executive leadership communication at startups in China The study of leadership is important for public relations, in that public relations practitioners are encouraged to participate in organizational leadership as members of the dominant coalition (cf. Grunig, Grunig, & Dozier, 2002) and in that the public relations function is encouraged to lead decision-making as the organization’s conscience (cf. Bowen, 2008; Neill & Drumwright, 2012; Ryan & Martinson, 1983). Thus, the article by Linjuan Rita Men, Zifei Fay Chen, and Yi Grace Ji is significant for its expansion of public relations theory on leadership and extension of this area of research into the contexts of start-up companies in China. The authors found that executive leaders’ management styles and character shape organizational culture, which they categorized into five types: innovation/adventure, openness, inclusiveness/participation, supportiveness, and aggressiveness/competitiveness. Effective leadership communication strategies were found to be symmetrical, transparent, authentic, and visionary. On one hand, these findings offer practical suggestions for enhancing the communication efforts of executive leaders in Chinese start-ups. On the other hand, the study also yields significant implications for developing theory at the intersection of public relations and leadership communication, in particular with the identification of visionary communication, which “emphasized the value and contributions of the company for high purpose in a broad social, cultural, economic, or political context” (p. 48). I look forward to future scholarship that further explicates this concept, perhaps by connecting it to real-world public relations phenomena in other countries, with different organization types, and under various leadership demographics.",academic_research,"Editor’s essay: Thoughts on theoryThe primary purpose of the Journal of Public Relations Research, since its founding, has been to help create, test, refine, or expand theory in public relations. Since commencing my editorship of this journal (work year 2015, credit year 2016), I have come to the chagrined realization that our journal’s very purpose is misunderstood by some authors, reviewers, and readers, for whom the phrase “theory in public relations” may not be quite clear. What is theory? At the most basic level, a theory is an idea or an explanation about how things work. As such, theories might come from a variety of sources that tell us what we know; these methods of knowing originally were articulated as tenacity, authority, taste, and science (see Pierce, 1877), with the method of taste now referred to as the method of intuition (see Wimmer & Dominick, 2014). The point of scientific endeavors (including social scientific efforts, as might be found in public relations) is to offer a method of knowing that is grounded in being public, objective, empirical, systematic, cumulative, predictive, and self-correcting (cf. Wimmer & Dominick, 2014). According to Reynolds (2007), scientific theories exist in at least two forms: (a) a theory can be “a set of well-supported empirical generalizations or ‘laws,’ … referred to as the ‘set-of-laws’ form of theory” (p. 8), or (b) a theory can be “an interrelated set of definitions, axioms, and propositions … called the ‘axiomatic’ form of theory” (pp. 8–9). As explained by Wimmer and Dominick (2014), “[a] theory is a set of related propositions that presents a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relationships among concepts” (p. 12). Really, then, theories are only as useful as the explanations that they can offer. In fact, Babbie (2014) actually defined theory as “a systematic explanation for the observations that relate to a particular aspect of life” (p. 9). Stinchcombe (1968), perhaps, expressed it best when he wrote that “theory ought to create the capacity to invent explanations” (p. 3, italics original). Thus, this journal seeks to publish research that will not only explain public relations phenomena, but also engender the creation of new theories in public relations. How are theories built? Creating new theories and enhancing existing theories are nonlinear processes. The various texts in theory construction all point to the constant interplay between the abstract and the empirical, between the conceptualized and the observed (e.g., Chaffee, 1991; Reynolds, 2007; Stinchcombe, 1968).

2018,3,Erich J. Sommerfeldt & Aimei Yang,Notes on a dialogue: twenty years of digital dialogic communication research in public relations,"Historically speaking, the use of mass communication channels in public relations practice has mirrored the diffusion of new technologies. Early 20th century public relations efforts largely relied on newspapers and magazines as channels to promote clients and causes. Radio and television became staple tools for public relations upon their introduction and mass diffusion through society. By and large, these technologies were one-way communication tools for public relations to transmit information to publics, and most often content must have first passed the scrutiny of media gatekeepers. However, with the introduction and widespread penetration of the Internet, public relations practitioners could communicate directly with publics on an unprecedented scale without the approval of media gatekeepers or conformity to their rules. Through so-called Web 1.0 platforms, like websites and early blogs, practitioners could create their own content and directly reach their publics—and they had no idea what to do. Early research on the adoption of Internet-enabled technologies by practitioners suggests they were indeed confused about what to make of this fledgling communication tool. Some embraced the new platform; others viewed it as a distraction. By the turn of the century, it was still considered noteworthy for public relations practitioners to utilize websites for public relations purposes, and many regarded the technology with skepticism as to its strategic value (Hill & White, 2000). It was within this murky and uncertain technological environment that Kent and Taylor (1998) proposed the five principles of dialogic communication in their article, “Building Dialogic Relationships Through the World Wide Web.” The article was the first comprehensive theoretical framework to guide the field of public relations in its use of digital communication. Their work was among the earliest public relations studies to recognize the relationship-building potential of digital communication technology (at that time, mostly websites) and to provide strategies for communication professionals seeking to build relationships with publics. In the 2 decades since the article’s publication, the dialogic principles have become a touchstone for the public relations literature, and Kent and Taylor’s (1998) article outlining the principles is among the most cited and influential articles in public relations history. The principles have been applied in fields such as public relations, advertising, marketing, management, organizational communication, and information studies. Hundreds of studies have used the dialogic principles to analyze various types of organizational websites (McAllister-Spooner, 2008; Taylor, Kent, & White, 2001; Yang & Taylor, 2010) and, more recently, social media accounts such as blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (e.g., Bortree & Seltzer, 2009; Gao, 2016; Linvill, McGee, & Hicks, 2012; Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010). Over the years, studies have attempted to verify and adapt the original principles, applying them within new contexts and relating them to various organizational characteristics (see Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018, for a comprehensive review of studies involving the principles of dialogic public relations). Unlike 20 years ago, computer-mediated communication is now an indispensable part of public relations practice. It is clear from the state of research and practice in public relations that the question is no longer if, but how to best use digital communication technologies to build relationships with publics. With new ways of engaging stakeholders on digital platforms and much wider-spread adoption of digital communication by organizations around the world, it is time to take another look at where we are and ask difficult questions about the potential for dialogic communication through digital media. For this purpose, at this 20-year anniversary, we dedicate this special issue to digital dialogic communication research by showcasing a number of articles that extend our thinking on dialogic theory and use this vital platform to raise interests and point to new directions. Understanding the dialogic promise Prescriptive theories of dialogue, such as those advanced by Pearson (1989), Botan (1997), and Kent and Taylor (1998, 2002), are heavily influenced by the work of Martin Buber (1970), wherein dialogue is seen as a specialized form of interpersonal communication. In brief, dialogue is foremost concerned with the attitudes held by each party in an interaction. Genuine dialogue sees communication partners as equals (I-Thou), rather than as mere recipients of persuasive messages (I-It). Botan (1997) explained that dialogue “elevates publics to the status of communication equal with the organization” (p. 196) as opposed to treating publics as objects to be segmented and responded to. Kent and Taylor (1998) took up the challenge of translating this deeply interpersonal theory to web-mediated communicative relationships. The aim of their work was to provide theory-based strategies to enhance organization–public relationships by making the Web more “personal.” These strategies—grounded in the assumptions of dialogue—took the form of five principles of web-based communication: the dialogic loop, features that allow publics to ask questions and for organizations to respond; usefulness of information, providing information of value to publics in a clear and logical structure; generation of return visits, features that attract publics back to websites and ways to create long-term relationships; intuitiveness/ease of interface, the simplicity and ease of website navigation; and conservation of visitors, features that conserve a user’s time and keeps them on the website. By building these strategies into websites, Kent and Taylor argued, organizations could work to fulfil the “dialogic promise” of digital media, thereby successfully integrating a form of interpersonal dialogue into web-based communication. The work attracted considerable attention because it not only reflected the field of public relations’ keen interest in using digital technologies for organization–public relationship building (the potential for which was unclear at that time), but also answered urgent calls for theorizing on this new communication platform. The principles have since been adapted in various studies, and measures have been developed aimed at demonstrating the degree to which each principle is manifested on website platforms (e.g., Taylor et al., 2001; Yang & Taylor, 2010). These instruments enabled researchers to gauge the extent to which organizations’ websites are dialogic (McAllister-Spooner, 2009) and examine the connection between utilization of dialogic principles and actual responsiveness and accessibility (Callison & Seltzer, 2010). The instruments have also been extensively applied in the examination of organizations’ social media communication. Indeed, the principles are more popular than ever before, with numerous studies utilizing the approach to understand organization–public relationship building through social media. Much of this research has found that although social media, as platforms, exhibit more dialogic potential than websites (e.g., Seltzer & Mitrook, 2007), many organizations still fail to fully utilize the potential of social media to be dialogic (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010), primarily using social media as tools for one-way information dissemination. 20 years of dialogic communication research: what’s next? An important goal of this special issue is not to simply look back and summarize what we have learned over the past 20 years, but also to discern new directions for theoretical development in digital dialogic communication research. To begin such a task, we must first understand the existing gaps and criticisms in the digital dialogic literature. Criticisms of the dialogic approach One of the most prominent criticisms, and perhaps failings, of the dialogic communication literature is the frequent conflation of dialogue with symmetrical communication (Grunig, 2001), where researchers “reify dialogue as a set of procedures” (Kent & Lane, 2017, p. 571), and equate any back and forth of communication with dialogue. This confusion often manifests in studies where researchers simply treat the presence of any interactive features or functions on organizations’ websites and social media accounts as evidence of a dialogic approach. In addition, the principles of dialogic communication have also been challenged by practitioners who fail to see value from the dialogic approach in daily practice, or are constrained by their issue positions or organizational resources to implement dialogic communication (Sommerfeldt, Kent, & Taylor, 2012). Others have criticized the theory for failing to account for power imbalances between organizations and their publics and the influence of factors such as social, political, and economic contexts on dialogic communication (Ihlen & Levenshus, 2017; Roper, 2005). Additionally, as technological innovations continue to revolutionize communication processes, emerging trends such as artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning may all pose new questions and challenges to dialogic communication and require the theory to evolve and adapt—or risk becoming irrelevant. New media environment, new challenges Some studies have begun exploring expansions or modifications of the dialogic principles in light of advances in digital communication technology, and more interactive social media platforms (Bortree & Seltzer, 2009; Gao, 2016; Linvill et al., 2012). Nonetheless, most of these efforts have focused on improving or modifying measurements; few have considered the actual fit between the original dialogic principles and characteristics of contemporary social media. As an example, many studies utilizing the principles choose to simply omit the ease of interface principle, as digital platforms like Facebook and Twitter provide the same interface for all users. A substantial extension of dialogic communication theory might, therefore, come from a deeper consideration of the unique characteristics of the social media communication context and their match or mismatch with dialogic principles; or through providing new connections among previous concepts, and exploring the practical implications of these connections. In any case, scholars should begin to question the applicability of the principles to the social media environment, and adapt—or even remake—them accordingly. Big data, social networks, and new methodological possibilities A new and exciting trend is the availability of big data and analytic tools that allow practitioners and scholars to assess publics’ online behavioral patterns at an unprecedented scale. Much like the case 20 years ago, the field of public relations is again at a crossroads, where data-driven insights are taking the field into new directions. Meaningful theories need to be able to answer the call of their times. For dialogic communication research to advance in this new age, scholars need to go beyond content analysis (a method used in the overwhelming majority of dialogic communication studies; cf. Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018), and embrace new methodological approaches such as big data, social networks, machine learning, and the triangulation of these methods. New methodological approaches would perhaps afford scholars the opportunity to develop new indicators of dialogic communication—perhaps even recognize new forms of enacting dialogue—and better model and predict outcomes of dialogic communication. New methodologies could also offer new approaches to examine the connection between dialogic feature utilization and actual responsiveness. Questioning the dialogic promise Systematic efforts should be taken to examine organizational and institutional barriers to the adoption and implementation of dialogic communication. Questions such as what institutional contexts, power dynamics, and socio-cultural contexts are more conducive or constraining for dialogic communication; how communication practitioners navigate complex stakeholder relationships and institutional barriers to engage stakeholders in dialogue need to be asked. Answering these questions may provide practical implications for practitioners who are puzzled about the applicability and relevance of dialogic communication. Finally, whereas most studies assume that dialogic communication brings positive, or at least benign, outcomes, little attention has been paid to examine the potential negative consequences of dialogic communication. Is there a dark side to dialogue? Kent and Taylor admit that engaging in the appearance of dialogue may be used for malfeasant purposes. Relatedly, are honesty, transparency, and mutuality always a possibility in digital communication? Moreover, what can we do to prevent unintended consequences on organizations, especially in the age of social media? After all, studies have consistently found most organizations fail to fully realize the dialogic promise of digital media. Answers to these questions could deepen our understanding of dialogic communication and revise the framework for the age of Facebook, Twitter, and future platforms with possibly even greater interactive potential and relationship building capacity. Contributions to the dialogue Digital communication will continue to dominate public relations practice and scholarship for the foreseeable future. If we hope to fully realize the potential of social media to be truly social and engage in dialogic relationship building, we must advance digital dialogic scholarship. The articles in this special issue are an effort toward that end. Each of these articles addresses a different facet of dialogic communication research and provides heuristic questions for future scholarship. First, Morehouse and Saffer examine the knowledge-construction networks of dialogic communication in 20 years of public relations literature. Their examination of scholarship networks in the field provides insights into the state of digital dialogic research and suggests that scholars must continue to mix their expertise and adopt different approaches to the study of digital dialogue. Next, Men, Tsai, Wan-Hsiu, Chen, and Ji add complexity to the dialogic approach by pairing examination of the dialogic principles with the concept of social presence—the extent to which an actor appears to be a real person online. As the roots of the dialogic approach are in interpersonal communication theory, the consideration of social presence on social media platforms provides an interesting new approach to examine the efficacy of dialogic communication with publics. Third, Uysal considers the dialogic principles in the context of investor relations and corporate social performance, revealing that more socially responsible corporations are more likely to engage in dialogic communication behavior. Finally, Ciszek and Logan question the relevance of the dialogic principles in social media research, and suggest that alternative perspectives such as dissensus and agonism may better reflect the nature of organization–public interactions, particularly in discussions on difficult social issues.",academic_research,"Notes on a dialogue: twenty years of digital dialogic communication research in public relationsHistorically speaking, the use of mass communication channels in public relations practice has mirrored the diffusion of new technologies.

It was within this murky and uncertain technological environment that Kent and Taylor (1998) proposed the five principles of dialogic communication in their article, “Building Dialogic Relationships Through the World Wide Web.” The article was the first comprehensive theoretical framework to guide the field of public relations in its use of digital communication. Their work was among the earliest public relations studies to recognize the relationship-building potential of digital communication technology (at that time, mostly websites) and to provide strategies for communication professionals seeking to build relationships with publics. In the 2 decades since the article’s publication, the dialogic principles have become a touchstone for the public relations literature, and Kent and Taylor’s (1998) article outlining the principles is among the most cited and influential articles in public relations history. The principles have been applied in fields such as public relations, advertising, marketing, management, organizational communication, and information studies. Hundreds of studies have used the dialogic principles to analyze various types of organizational websites (McAllister-Spooner, 2008; Taylor, Kent, & White, 2001; Yang & Taylor, 2010) and, more recently, social media accounts such as blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (e.g., Bortree & Seltzer, 2009; Gao, 2016; Linvill, McGee, & Hicks, 2012; Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010). Over the years, studies have attempted to verify and adapt the original principles, applying them within new contexts and relating them to various organizational characteristics (see Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018, for a comprehensive review of studies involving the principles of dialogic public relations). Unlike 20 years ago, computer-mediated communication is now an indispensable part of public relations practice. It is clear from the state of research and practice in public relations that the question is no longer if, but how to best use digital communication technologies to build relationships with publics. With new ways of engaging stakeholders on digital platforms and much wider-spread adoption of digital communication by organizations around the world, it is time to take another look at where we are and ask difficult questions about the potential for dialogic communication through digital media. For this purpose, at this 20-year anniversary, we dedicate this special issue to digital dialogic communication research by showcasing a number of articles that extend our thinking on dialogic theory and use this vital platform to raise interests and point to new directions. Understanding the dialogic promise Prescriptive theories of dialogue, such as those advanced by Pearson (1989), Botan (1997), and Kent and Taylor (1998, 2002), are heavily influenced by the work of Martin Buber (1970), wherein dialogue is seen as a specialized form of interpersonal communication. In brief, dialogue is foremost concerned with the attitudes held by each party in an interaction. Genuine dialogue sees communication partners as equals (I-Thou), rather than as mere recipients of persuasive messages (I-It). Botan (1997) explained that dialogue “elevates publics to the status of communication equal with the organization” (p. 196) as opposed to treating publics as objects to be segmented and responded to. Kent and Taylor (1998) took up the challenge of translating this deeply interpersonal theory to web-mediated communicative relationships. The aim of their work was to provide theory-based strategies to enhance organization–public relationships by making the Web more “personal.” These strategies—grounded in the assumptions of dialogue—took the form of five principles of web-based communication: the dialogic loop, features that allow publics to ask questions and for organizations to respond; usefulness of information, providing information of value to publics in a clear and logical structure; generation of return visits, features that attract publics back to websites and ways to create long-term relationships; intuitiveness/ease of interface, the simplicity and ease of website navigation; and conservation of visitors, features that conserve a user’s time and keeps them on the website. By building these strategies into websites, Kent and Taylor argued, organizations could work to fulfil the “dialogic promise” of digital media, thereby successfully integrating a form of interpersonal dialogue into web-based communication. The work attracted considerable attention because it not only reflected the field of public relations’ keen interest in using digital technologies for organization–public relationship building (the potential for which was unclear at that time), but also answered urgent calls for theorizing on this new communication platform. The principles have since been adapted in various studies, and measures have been developed aimed at demonstrating the degree to which each principle is manifested on website platforms (e.g., Taylor et al., 2001; Yang & Taylor, 2010). These instruments enabled researchers to gauge the extent to which organizations’ websites are dialogic (McAllister-Spooner, 2009) and examine the connection between utilization of dialogic principles and actual responsiveness and accessibility (Callison & Seltzer, 2010). The instruments have also been extensively applied in the examination of organizations’ social media communication. Indeed, the principles are more popular than ever before, with numerous studies utilizing the approach to understand organization–public relationship building through social media. Much of this research has found that although social media, as platforms, exhibit more dialogic potential than websites (e.g., Seltzer & Mitrook, 2007), many organizations still fail to fully utilize the potential of social media to be dialogic (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010), primarily using social media as tools for one-way information dissemination. 20 years of dialogic communication research: what’s next? An important goal of this special issue is not to simply look back and summarize what we have learned over the past 20 years, but also to discern new directions for theoretical development in digital dialogic communication research. To begin such a task, we must first understand the existing gaps and criticisms in the digital dialogic literature. Criticisms of the dialogic approach One of the most prominent criticisms, and perhaps failings, of the dialogic communication literature is the frequent conflation of dialogue with symmetrical communication (Grunig, 2001), where researchers “reify dialogue as a set of procedures” (Kent & Lane, 2017, p. 571), and equate any back and forth of communication with dialogue. This confusion often manifests in studies where researchers simply treat the presence of any interactive features or functions on organizations’ websites and social media accounts as evidence of a dialogic approach. In addition, the principles of dialogic communication have also been challenged by practitioners who fail to see value from the dialogic approach in daily practice, or are constrained by their issue positions or organizational resources to implement dialogic communication (Sommerfeldt, Kent, & Taylor, 2012). Others have criticized the theory for failing to account for power imbalances between organizations and their publics and the influence of factors such as social, political, and economic contexts on dialogic communication (Ihlen & Levenshus, 2017; Roper, 2005). Additionally, as technological innovations continue to revolutionize communication processes, emerging trends such as artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning may all pose new questions and challenges to dialogic communication and require the theory to evolve and adapt—or risk becoming irrelevant. New media environment, new challenges Some studies have begun exploring expansions or modifications of the dialogic principles in light of advances in digital communication technology, and more interactive social media platforms (Bortree & Seltzer, 2009; Gao, 2016; Linvill et al., 2012). Nonetheless, most of these efforts have focused on improving or modifying measurements; few have considered the actual fit between the original dialogic principles and characteristics of contemporary social media. As an example, many studies utilizing the principles choose to simply omit the ease of interface principle, as digital platforms like Facebook and Twitter provide the same interface for all users. A substantial extension of dialogic communication theory might, therefore, come from a deeper consideration of the unique characteristics of the social media communication context and their match or mismatch with dialogic principles; or through providing new connections among previous concepts, and exploring the practical implications of these connections. In any case, scholars should begin to question the applicability of the principles to the social media environment, and adapt—or even remake—them accordingly. Big data, social networks, and new methodological possibilities A new and exciting trend is the availability of big data and analytic tools that allow practitioners and scholars to assess publics’ online behavioral patterns at an unprecedented scale. Much like the case 20 years ago, the field of public relations is again at a crossroads, where data-driven insights are taking the field into new directions. Meaningful theories need to be able to answer the call of their times. For dialogic communication research to advance in this new age, scholars need to go beyond content analysis (a method used in the overwhelming majority of dialogic communication studies; cf. Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018), and embrace new methodological approaches such as big data, social networks, machine learning, and the triangulation of these methods. New methodological approaches would perhaps afford scholars the opportunity to develop new indicators of dialogic communication—perhaps even recognize new forms of enacting dialogue—and better model and predict outcomes of dialogic communication. New methodologies could also offer new approaches to examine the connection between dialogic feature utilization and actual responsiveness. Questioning the dialogic promise Systematic efforts should be taken to examine organizational and institutional barriers to the adoption and implementation of dialogic communication. Questions such as what institutional contexts, power dynamics, and socio-cultural contexts are more conducive or constraining for dialogic communication; how communication practitioners navigate complex stakeholder relationships and institutional barriers to engage stakeholders in dialogue need to be asked. Answering these questions may provide practical implications for practitioners who are puzzled about the applicability and relevance of dialogic communication. Finally, whereas most studies assume that dialogic communication brings positive, or at least benign, outcomes, little attention has been paid to examine the potential negative consequences of dialogic communication. Is there a dark side to dialogue? Kent and Taylor admit that engaging in the appearance of dialogue may be used for malfeasant purposes. Relatedly, are honesty, transparency, and mutuality always a possibility in digital communication? Moreover, what can we do to prevent unintended consequences on organizations, especially in the age of social media? After all, studies have consistently found most organizations fail to fully realize the dialogic promise of digital media. Answers to these questions could deepen our understanding of dialogic communication and revise the framework for the age of Facebook, Twitter, and future platforms with possibly even greater interactive potential and relationship building capacity. Contributions to the dialogue Digital communication will continue to dominate public relations practice and scholarship for the foreseeable future. If we hope to fully realize the potential of social media to be truly social and engage in dialogic relationship building, we must advance digital dialogic scholarship. The articles in this special issue are an effort toward that end. Each of these articles addresses a different facet of dialogic communication research and provides heuristic questions for future scholarship. First, Morehouse and Saffer examine the knowledge-construction networks of dialogic communication in 20 years of public relations literature. Their examination of scholarship networks in the field provides insights into the state of digital dialogic research and suggests that scholars must continue to mix their expertise and adopt different approaches to the study of digital dialogue. Next, Men, Tsai, Wan-Hsiu, Chen, and Ji add complexity to the dialogic approach by pairing examination of the dialogic principles with the concept of social presence—the extent to which an actor appears to be a real person online. As the roots of the dialogic approach are in interpersonal communication theory, the consideration of social presence on social media platforms provides an interesting new approach to examine the efficacy of dialogic communication with publics. Third, Uysal considers the dialogic principles in the context of investor relations and corporate social performance, revealing that more socially responsible corporations are more likely to engage in dialogic communication behavior. Finally, Ciszek and Logan question the relevance of the dialogic principles in social media research, and suggest that alternative perspectives such as dissensus and agonism may better reflect the nature of organization–public interactions, particularly in discussions on difficult social issues."

2018,4,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay: Identity and/in/of public relations,"In this themed issue, the Journal looks at the intersection of public relations and identity, which has been part of my academic research agenda for decades, inasmuch as the concept of identity has been an area of personal interest for me since childhood. Even before I knew any words to attach to the concept of identity, my lived experiences etched the importance of identity into my mind and thus into my intellectual journey. As one example, in my kindergarten class at Morningside Elementary in Salt Lake City, Utah, students returned from Thanksgiving break to report on what they had eaten the past Thursday with their families. Feeling very embarrassed and out of place, I shared that my (immigrant) family had eaten noodles; all my classmates, one after another, recounted turkey-centered meals accompanied by various side dishes (none of which were noodles). As a college junior studying in France, I was publicly accosted by a White Frenchman who screamed at me (in French) that France was not a Japanese colony and that I should “go home,” never mind that my heritage is Chinese (not Japanese) and that my home was (and remains) the United States, not anywhere in Asia. Identity research in public relations In some ways, the start of identity-related research in public relations began with the work of scholars investigating such lived experiences of minority practitioners, particularly African Americans and Hispanic Americans (e.g., Kern-Foxworth, 1989; Kern-Foxworth, Gandy, Hines, & Miller, 1994; Layton, 1980; Len-Rios, 1998; Zerbinos & Clanton, 1993), as well as women (e.g., Cline et al., 1986; Toth & Cline, 1989). Later research connected various theoretical concepts in public relations to identity-defined practitioner groups delineated by race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation (e.g., Ciszek & Logan, 2018; Ki, 2004; Mundy, 2015; Pompper, 2004, 2007; Sha, 1995, 2006; Sha & Ford, 2007; Tindall, 2009; Tindall & Waters, 2013). Other research at the intersection of identity and public relations has examined the concept of identity beyond the boundaries of cultural groups. For example, Curtin and Gaither (2005) examined identity as one of five moments in their cultural-economic model of public relations. Sha (2009) connected organizational identities to organizational mission statements and public relations behaviors. Lellis (2012, p. 508) articulated “cause identity” as being a strong collective identity shared among organizations allied in support of a social cause. Sha, Tindall, and Sha (2012) connected organizational identity to corporate image and reputation. Ma (2018) examined the impact of organizational identity on publics’ attributions of guilt to organizations in times of crisis. Ni, Wang, and Sha (2019) incorporated identity into a theoretical framework for managing relationships (and conflict) with organizational publics. In short, identity research in public relations, like the essence of identity itself, is constantly evolving. In the words of Hall (1994): Cultural identity … is a matter of “becoming” as well as of “being.” It belongs to the future as much as to the past. It is not something which already exists, transcending place, time, history, and culture. Cultural identities come from somewhere, have histories. But, like everything which is historical, they undergo constant transformation. Far from being eternally fixed in some essentialised past, they are subject to the continuous “play” of history, culture, and power. (p. 225) Identity of public relations Just as public relations scholarship in the area of identity has evolved over time, so has the identity of public relations itself, both as a professional practice and as an academic discipline. Indeed, one of the challenges of being a journal devoted to the development of theory in public relations is that, at times, the very definition of public relations is unclear. Traditionally, core knowledge—such as definitions—of a subject area is disseminated in a field’s textbooks (Hilty, 2011), even though such knowledge, as disseminated, has sometimes generated both political and cultural controversy (cf. Britton, Woodward, Binkley, & Woodward, 1993). In the most recently available citation analysis of public relations scholarship, Pasadeos, Berger, and Renfro (2010) noted that, from 2000 to 2005, the top-cited textbooks in public relations were Grunig and Hunt (1984) and Cutlip, Center, and Broom (1985, 1994). In their textbook, Managing Public Relations, Grunig and Hunt (1984) deﬁned public relations as the “management of communication between an organization and its publics” (p. 4). The most-recent edition of Cutlip & Center’s Effective Public Relations textbook defines public relations as “the management function that establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on whom its success or failure depends” (Broom & Sha, 2013. p. 2). Although textbooks and professional associations in the field have offered myriad variations on definitions of public relations, four consistent elements across definitions are specified or implied to be (a) a focal organization or some other originator of activities and communications, (b) a public defined in relation to that organization or originator, (c) the organization-public relationship, and (d) the management of that relationship. In this themed issue on identity and public relations, three articles examine the intersection of identity and public relations in quite different ways, while reflecting the history of not only that intersection, but also the field itself. Queering PR: Directions in theory and research for public relations scholarship Hall’s (1994) assertion that identity is a process of becoming, inasmuch as it is a matter of being, is well reflected in the article by Erica Ciszek, who offers some political and theoretical foundations of queer theory and articulates why queer theory should, and does, matter to the identity of public relations. For starters, queer theory is not about studying any specific identity group (e.g., lesbians or gays), but about critiquing, problematizing, and deconstructing identities, which themselves are “multiple, unstable, and fluid,” as Ciszek notes on page x. As we enter an era of fluid identities, this article’s call for “proceeding queerly” (p. x) places public relations research squarely in the midst of that challenge, positioned to interrogate the subjectivities and intersectionalities of organizational publics and organizations themselves. In that process, scholars should carefully consider “the role of public relations in the production of a culture of normativity and the processes of constructing practices and identities that reinforce hierarchies” (p. x). For this journal in particular, Ciszek’s work reminds us that the very definition of theory in a journal purporting to advance theory in public relations should be interrogated, as should be the notions of research and the standards by which that research that is deemed scientifically sound. Indeed, if “queer inquiry is a theoretical approach that problematizes binaries, resists identity as essential, challenges categorization, examines underlying power relations, and reveals contextuality,” as Ciszek notes (p. x), then what is the impact of queering on we scholars, ourselves? If queer theory, indeed, breaks down all categories, including binary ones such as scholar/practitioner, then who are we as humans in this category labeled “scholars?” If our own scholarly identity is both unstable and fluid, what impact does that have on the success or failure of individual public relations scholars in the tenure and promotion processes currently in place in universities? And if our disciplinary identity is so multiple and in flux, how do (or should?) we maintain our academic space as requiring independent curricular programs, or our academic place as meriting a discipline-centered research journal? Understanding immigrant internal publics of organizations: Immigrant professionals’ adaptation and identity development Taking a different scholarly approach to questions at the intersection of identity and public relations, Lan Ni, Qi Wang, and Anushree Gogate introduce in their article the concept of intercultural identity, an identity that spans different cultures. Their research extends the notion of avowed cultural identity to investigate the development of identities of immigrant professionals through processes of stress and adaptation. In particular, their investigation into how “cultural identity is formed in the first place and reformed when exposed to a second culture long term” (p. x, emphasis original) makes an important contribution to theory-building in public relations, which, to date, has largely studied cultural identity as a research concept without troubling too much to consider its ontological origins as a lived experience. This article offers methodological exemplars in its careful descriptions of processes of sampling, data collection, data analysis, and researcher reflexivity, all of which demonstrate standards of rigorous scholarship in qualitative research. Furthermore, the conceptual framework presented here demonstrates the value of drawing on theories from other disciplines, in this case from intercultural communication, specifically from intercultural communication competence. Beyond its application in this article to the development of micro-level identities of individual immigrant professionals, the stress-adaptation-growth model (cf. Kim, 2005) might be interesting, I believe, if applied to the meso-level identities of organizations as corporate bodies responding to environmental stressors and adapting to new organizational contexts, possibly growing new identity dimensions in that process. Of course, the concept of intercultural identity also offers fertile ground for future research on organizational publics. In addition to the research directions identified by the authors, future studies might consider immigrant employees working in non-white-collar jobs (e.g., lower-skilled employees), as well as involuntary immigrants (e.g., refugees, trafficked workers, enslaved laborers), all with the appropriate sensitivities and protocols for working with vulnerable research populations. Building theory in public relations: Interorganizational relationships as a public relations paradigm Regarding matters of appropriate sensitivity in research and evolving scholarship in a research field, I note that Mary Ann Ferguson’s article was first presented at an academic conference in 1984, when she issued what turned out to be a foundational call to focus on relationships in public relations research. Apparently, that call was not initially heeded in earnest by the community of public relations scholars, perhaps in part because when the original manuscript was presented, a powerful senior scholar in attendance purportedly pooh-poohed the research. Three decades later, Ferguson’s 1984 conference paper has been cited hundreds of times the world over, including by scholars who may not have ever actually read the manuscript. I came to be in possession of an original copy of the 1984 conference paper years ago, when my San Diego State colleague, Susan Hellweg (who had been in attendance when the paper was presented), was cleaning out her office while getting ready to retire from her academic career. When reviewing manuscripts for this themed issue on identity and public relations, I realized anew that our fundamental identity as a field, that of being grounded in relationships between organizations and publics, owed much to that 1984 Ferguson manuscript, which had never been published. Thus, I called the author and got her permission to print the conference paper. But getting from permission to publication turned out to be an arduous process, as Ferguson herself no longer had ready access to a copy of the manuscript. Thus, I converted my faded paper copy into a hard-to-read portable document file (pdf), which then had to be converted to a less-than-accurate text file (MS Word), so that edits could be implemented. My sincere thanks go to Thomas (T. J.) Alexander and Maria Len-Rios at the University of Georgia for their initial contributions to this painstaking process. Upon receiving the edited text file, I did a word-by-word comparison against my paper copy, which was far more difficult than one would think necessary. From there, I had to make tough calls about what to edit (egregious typos, certainly) and what to leave alone (missing commas, possibly). Ultimately, I believe that, despite the manuscript’s long road to becoming a journal article, its essential being remains pertinent to public relations scholarship today. In particular, I am struck by how well Ferguson’s work foreshadowed current research on the dimensions of organization-public relationships, as well as by how little has evolved in our field. As one example of the latter, I note that the general categories of research induced by Ferguson—social responsibility and ethics, professionalism, education, program implementation, history, public relations as management, communication technology—all are iterated in current public relations scholarship, but relatively precious few manuscripts really focus on public relations theory development. Within those general categories, scholars today ask the same basic research questions that Ferguson notes throughout her article, and educators today feel “equally beset with demands” (p. x) to publish their research, to teach their students, and to serve their institutions. We also still face today the same questions of paradigm, which I would term questions of paradigmatic identity. Even so, I note that identity evolution is likewise reflected in Ferguson’s article. For example, the Association for Education in Journalism has become the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, reflecting an identity shift of a broader discipline to which public relations belongs. The scholar cited in 1984 as L. Schneider is today L. Grunig, and J. Van Slyke is J. Turk, offering a gendered lens through which to glimpse the identity evolution of some individual public relations scholars. To me, the publication of this article in its near-original, conference-paper form offers the following key message to our scholarly community, as we continue to research identity and/in/of public relations: Public relations is still becoming, and we scholars (as humans; or perhaps we humans, as scholars) should continue to interrogate our own ontology, epistemology, and axiology. As we consider ontological questions, we should respect our past, even while problematizing it in the present, toward a fluid future. As we reflect on epistemological questions, we should respect the diversity of views and voices in our discipline, even when chaos and cacophony feel, at times, overwhelming. As we pose axiological questions, we should respect all scholarship done rigorously, regardless of scholarly method, affiliation, or status. And here I offer a special note to graduate students, non-US-based scholars, and those working in marginalized territories of inquiry: Remember that your work is valuable and has value, even if that value is not immediately recognized by the scholarly establishment. Just look at the provenance of this article by Mary Ann Ferguson.",academic_research,"Editor’s essay: Identity and/in/of public relationsIn this themed issue, the Journal looks at the intersection of public relations and identity, which has been part of my academic research agenda for decades, inasmuch as the concept of identity has been an area of personal interest for me since childhood.

Sha, Tindall, and Sha (2012) connected organizational identity to corporate image and reputation. Ma (2018) examined the impact of organizational identity on publics’ attributions of guilt to organizations in times of crisis. Ni, Wang, and Sha (2019) incorporated identity into a theoretical framework for managing relationships (and conflict) with organizational publics. In short, identity research in public relations, like the essence of identity itself, is constantly evolving. In the words of Hall (1994): Cultural identity … is a matter of “becoming” as well as of “being.” It belongs to the future as much as to the past. It is not something which already exists, transcending place, time, history, and culture. Cultural identities come from somewhere, have histories. But, like everything which is historical, they undergo constant transformation. Far from being eternally fixed in some essentialised past, they are subject to the continuous “play” of history, culture, and power. (p. 225) Identity of public relations Just as public relations scholarship in the area of identity has evolved over time, so has the identity of public relations itself, both as a professional practice and as an academic discipline. Indeed, one of the challenges of being a journal devoted to the development of theory in public relations is that, at times, the very definition of public relations is unclear. Traditionally, core knowledge—such as definitions—of a subject area is disseminated in a field’s textbooks (Hilty, 2011), even though such knowledge, as disseminated, has sometimes generated both political and cultural controversy (cf. Britton, Woodward, Binkley, & Woodward, 1993). In the most recently available citation analysis of public relations scholarship, Pasadeos, Berger, and Renfro (2010) noted that, from 2000 to 2005, the top-cited textbooks in public relations were Grunig and Hunt (1984) and Cutlip, Center, and Broom (1985, 1994). In their textbook, Managing Public Relations, Grunig and Hunt (1984) deﬁned public relations as the “management of communication between an organization and its publics” (p. 4). The most-recent edition of Cutlip & Center’s Effective Public Relations textbook defines public relations as “the management function that establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on whom its success or failure depends” (Broom & Sha, 2013. p. 2). Although textbooks and professional associations in the field have offered myriad variations on definitions of public relations, four consistent elements across definitions are specified or implied to be (a) a focal organization or some other originator of activities and communications, (b) a public defined in relation to that organization or originator, (c) the organization-public relationship, and (d) the management of that relationship. In this themed issue on identity and public relations, three articles examine the intersection of identity and public relations in quite different ways, while reflecting the history of not only that intersection, but also the field itself. Queering PR: Directions in theory and research for public relations scholarship Hall’s (1994) assertion that identity is a process of becoming, inasmuch as it is a matter of being, is well reflected in the article by Erica Ciszek, who offers some political and theoretical foundations of queer theory and articulates why queer theory should, and does, matter to the identity of public relations. For starters, queer theory is not about studying any specific identity group (e.g., lesbians or gays), but about critiquing, problematizing, and deconstructing identities, which themselves are “multiple, unstable, and fluid,” as Ciszek notes on page x. As we enter an era of fluid identities, this article’s call for “proceeding queerly” (p. x) places public relations research squarely in the midst of that challenge, positioned to interrogate the subjectivities and intersectionalities of organizational publics and organizations themselves. In that process, scholars should carefully consider “the role of public relations in the production of a culture of normativity and the processes of constructing practices and identities that reinforce hierarchies” (p. x). For this journal in particular, Ciszek’s work reminds us that the very definition of theory in a journal purporting to advance theory in public relations should be interrogated, as should be the notions of research and the standards by which that research that is deemed scientifically sound. Indeed, if “queer inquiry is a theoretical approach that problematizes binaries, resists identity as essential, challenges categorization, examines underlying power relations, and reveals contextuality,” as Ciszek notes (p. x), then what is the impact of queering on we scholars, ourselves? If queer theory, indeed, breaks down all categories, including binary ones such as scholar/practitioner, then who are we as humans in this category labeled “scholars?” If our own scholarly identity is both unstable and fluid, what impact does that have on the success or failure of individual public relations scholars in the tenure and promotion processes currently in place in universities? And if our disciplinary identity is so multiple and in flux, how do (or should?) we maintain our academic space as requiring independent curricular programs, or our academic place as meriting a discipline-centered research journal? Understanding immigrant internal publics of organizations: Immigrant professionals’ adaptation and identity development Taking a different scholarly approach to questions at the intersection of identity and public relations, Lan Ni, Qi Wang, and Anushree Gogate introduce in their article the concept of intercultural identity, an identity that spans different cultures. Their research extends the notion of avowed cultural identity to investigate the development of identities of immigrant professionals through processes of stress and adaptation. In particular, their investigation into how “cultural identity is formed in the first place and reformed when exposed to a second culture long term” (p. x, emphasis original) makes an important contribution to theory-building in public relations, which, to date, has largely studied cultural identity as a research concept without troubling too much to consider its ontological origins as a lived experience. This article offers methodological exemplars in its careful descriptions of processes of sampling, data collection, data analysis, and researcher reflexivity, all of which demonstrate standards of rigorous scholarship in qualitative research. Furthermore, the conceptual framework presented here demonstrates the value of drawing on theories from other disciplines, in this case from intercultural communication, specifically from intercultural communication competence. Beyond its application in this article to the development of micro-level identities of individual immigrant professionals, the stress-adaptation-growth model (cf. Kim, 2005) might be interesting, I believe, if applied to the meso-level identities of organizations as corporate bodies responding to environmental stressors and adapting to new organizational contexts, possibly growing new identity dimensions in that process. Of course, the concept of intercultural identity also offers fertile ground for future research on organizational publics. In addition to the research directions identified by the authors, future studies might consider immigrant employees working in non-white-collar jobs (e.g., lower-skilled employees), as well as involuntary immigrants (e.g., refugees, trafficked workers, enslaved laborers), all with the appropriate sensitivities and protocols for working with vulnerable research populations. Building theory in public relations: Interorganizational relationships as a public relations paradigm Regarding matters of appropriate sensitivity in research and evolving scholarship in a research field, I note that Mary Ann Ferguson’s article was first presented at an academic conference in 1984, when she issued what turned out to be a foundational call to focus on relationships in public relations research. Apparently, that call was not initially heeded in earnest by the community of public relations scholars, perhaps in part because when the original manuscript was presented, a powerful senior scholar in attendance purportedly pooh-poohed the research. Three decades later, Ferguson’s 1984 conference paper has been cited hundreds of times the world over, including by scholars who may not have ever actually read the manuscript. I came to be in possession of an original copy of the 1984 conference paper years ago, when my San Diego State colleague, Susan Hellweg (who had been in attendance when the paper was presented), was cleaning out her office while getting ready to retire from her academic career. When reviewing manuscripts for this themed issue on identity and public relations, I realized anew that our fundamental identity as a field, that of being grounded in relationships between organizations and publics, owed much to that 1984 Ferguson manuscript, which had never been published. Thus, I called the author and got her permission to print the conference paper. But getting from permission to publication turned out to be an arduous process, as Ferguson herself no longer had ready access to a copy of the manuscript. Thus, I converted my faded paper copy into a hard-to-read portable document file (pdf), which then had to be converted to a less-than-accurate text file (MS Word), so that edits could be implemented. My sincere thanks go to Thomas (T. J.) Alexander and Maria Len-Rios at the University of Georgia for their initial contributions to this painstaking process. Upon receiving the edited text file, I did a word-by-word comparison against my paper copy, which was far more difficult than one would think necessary. From there, I had to make tough calls about what to edit (egregious typos, certainly) and what to leave alone (missing commas, possibly). Ultimately, I believe that, despite the manuscript’s long road to becoming a journal article, its essential being remains pertinent to public relations scholarship today. In particular, I am struck by how well Ferguson’s work foreshadowed current research on the dimensions of organization-public relationships, as well as by how little has evolved in our field. As one example of the latter, I note that the general categories of research induced by Ferguson—social responsibility and ethics, professionalism, education, program implementation, history, public relations as management, communication technology—all are iterated in current public relations scholarship, but relatively precious few manuscripts really focus on public relations theory development. Within those general categories, scholars today ask the same basic research questions that Ferguson notes throughout her article, and educators today feel “equally beset with demands” (p. x) to publish their research, to teach their students, and to serve their institutions. We also still face today the same questions of paradigm, which I would term questions of paradigmatic identity. Even so, I note that identity evolution is likewise reflected in Ferguson’s article. For example, the Association for Education in Journalism has become the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, reflecting an identity shift of a broader discipline to which public relations belongs. The scholar cited in 1984 as L. Schneider is today L. Grunig, and J. Van Slyke is J. Turk, offering a gendered lens through which to glimpse the identity evolution of some individual public relations scholars. To me, the publication of this article in its near-original, conference-paper form offers the following key message to our scholarly community, as we continue to research identity and/in/of public relations: Public relations is still becoming, and we scholars (as humans; or perhaps we humans, as scholars) should continue to interrogate our own ontology, epistemology, and axiology. As we consider ontological questions, we should respect our past, even while problematizing it in the present, toward a fluid future. As we reflect on epistemological questions, we should respect the diversity of views and voices in our discipline, even when chaos and cacophony feel, at times, overwhelming. As we pose axiological questions, we should respect all scholarship done rigorously, regardless of scholarly method, affiliation, or status. And here I offer a special note to graduate students, non-US-based scholars, and those working in marginalized territories of inquiry: Remember that your work is valuable and has value, even if that value is not immediately recognized by the scholarly establishment. Just look at the provenance of this article by Mary Ann Ferguson."

2018,5&6,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay: From anxiety to action,"The articles in this issue illustrate various reasons why people may feel anxious or stressed: societal changes, health concerns, social activism, relationships, crises, etc. In short, today’s world appears to offer no shortage of opportunities to feel anxious. Stress and anxiety One study by the American Psychological Association (2017) revealed that 63% of Americans indicated “the future of the nation” to be a significant source of stress, whereas 62% were stressed about money, 61% about work, and 57% about the “current political climate” (p. 1). One year later, the numbers rose to 69% reporting significant stress about the future of the nation, 64% about both work and money, and 62% about the current political climate (American Psychological Association, 2018). In short, stress levels are rising in general, at least in the United States. In some respects, of course, feeling stressed to some extent is normal, because “stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand” (5 Things You Should Know About Stress, n.d., n.p.), and “occasional anxiety is an expected part of life” (National Institute of Mental Health, 2018, n.p.). Defined as “apprehensive uneasiness or nervousness usually over an impending or anticipated ill” and “mentally distressing concern or interest” (Merriam-Webster, 2019, n.p.), anxiety happens to us all, at one point or another. One common instrument used by researchers to measure anxiety is the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) originated by Spielberger, Gorsuch, and Lushene (1970). Extending the conceptual usefulness of the STAI, Siddaway, Taylor, and Wood (2018) found that anxiety can be measured not merely by its presence or absence, but rather on a continuum of anxiety-calmness. Acceptance and action Indeed, keeping calm is one way to oppose the impact of anxiety. Specific anxiety-management strategies recommended by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (n.d.) include: accepting the inability to control everything; maintaining a positive attitude; getting enough sleep and exercise; taking deep breaths; and getting help from family, friends, and professional healthcare providers. Recent studies show that effective strategies for handling anxiety include forms of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; cf. Bluett, Homan, Morrison, Levin, & Twohig, 2014; Swain, Hancock, Hainsworth, & Bowman, 2013). For example, Dehghani, Saf, Vosoughi, Tebbenouri, and Zarnagh (2018) found that sports competition anxiety was decreased in students who underwent a mindfulness- and acceptance-based intervention. Monteiro, Fonseca, Pereira, Alves, and Canavarro (2018) found that women who were more accepting of their situations and of themselves in the form of self-compassion were less likely to develop anxiety and depression post-partum. Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, and Lillis (2006) conceptualized ACT as being composed of six core processes: acceptance, defusion, contact with the present moment, self as context, values, and committed action. Committed action is a pattern of “effective action linked to chosen values” (p. 9). On a similar note, the American Psychological Association (2018) reported that people have been taking action in response to their stress, with 70% of respondents indicating intention to vote and 57% having taken some kind of action in the last year, such as volunteering or supporting a cause, signing a petition, or speaking with family and friends about political views. I wonder if public relations scholarship would benefit from using the extensively validated STAI (cf. Lonner & Ibrahim, 1989) to investigate anxiety as part of our own ongoing research into the role of emotions in the formation of publics (see, for example, Coombs & Holladay, 2005, 2007; Jin, Pang, & Cameron, 2010; Kim & Niederdeppe, 2013). In addition, while committed action as a core process of ACT strategies has very specific connotations in the field of cognitive and behavioral therapy, public relations scholars might consider ways in which this process, as generated in individuals, might extrapolate to organizational publics responding to anxieties of their own. “Public Relations and Social Morality as National Identity: A Cultural-Economic Examination of the US Government’s Fight Against Venereal Disease in the 1920s” William Anderson offers a fascinating examination of three health campaigns conducted by the US Public Health Service in the 1920s to encourage positive social behaviors in a time of social change. His findings underscore the importance of studying producer motivation or intent as a means to clarify the moment of production in the cultural-economic model (CEM) of public relations (cf. Curtin & Gaither, 2005, 2007). Because all five moments are interconnected, the influence of motivation on the moment of production also implies its influence on regulation, representation, consumption, and identity. Indeed, this historically focused article on the crafting of national identity via public relations efforts feels to me quite contemporary, given its examination of that identity during a moment of cultural concern regarding its future. As Anderson explains, the post-WWI increase in immigration (from non-English-speaking countries) and the migration (of African Americans) to cities from rural areas were social forces that appeared to some conservatives to be “changing what it meant to be American” (p. x, emphasis original), and one can hear strong echoes of that perspective in our own current events. Methodologically, the article demonstrates how an historical case study can extend theory in public relations, while emphasizing the importance of avoiding presentism, or judging the past by the standards of the present. I appreciated the author’s reminder of the warning articulated by Lamme and Russell (2010), that public relations scholars avoid a linear approach that treats the history of our discipline as “progressive evolution” (p. 281), in which past practices are viewed as being less sophisticated and less ethical, compared to today’s public relations activities. “From Concerned Citizens to Activists: A Case Study of 2015 South Korean MERS Outbreak on the Role of Dialogic Government Communication and Citizens’ Emotions on Public Activism” Anyone keeping up with current events will be unsurprised by the key finding in this study by Minjeong Kang, Jangyul Robert Kim, and Heewon Cha, that “anger, anxiety, and cynicism significantly motivated citizens’ intentions to take actions against the government” (p. x.). What I found particularly interesting was that, although anger, anxiety, and cynicism all predicted intentions of activism, only cynicism predicted actual activism behaviors (and in a negative direction). This article also elucidates the complex roles played by other variables in the process of getting people from cognition to affect to behavior, including perceptions of dialogic communication, distrust in government, and situational uncertainty. This article demonstrates a thoughtful, nuanced treatment of various related concepts and offers the opportunity to review good practices in moving from the conceptualization to the operationalization of variables. For example, when asked by reviewers during the review process to explain why some variables in the study were treated as summative indices and others were not, the lead author explained, “Anger and anxiety are emotions and to capture the intensity of emotions, summative indices (cumulative) were used for them, while cynicism is a political sentiment, [for] which each item of the scale captured [a] slightly different aspect of the cynical political sentiment” (Kang, 2018, n.p.). The article offers Dillard and Anderson (2004) to justify the summative indexing of emotions and Dean, Brandes, and Dharwadkar (1998) to support the notion of cynicism as multidimensional. Extending public relations theory into non-English-language terrain, the authors also discuss the connotative distinctions between two related terms in the Korean language: So-Tong (communication) and Dae-Wha (dialogue). What can English-language scholarship in public relations learn from these distinctive Korean words? What are the theoretical implications of exploring English-language-grounded concepts in a non-English language (cf. Sha, 2017)? I look forward to future studies shedding light on these questions. “The Influence of Distal Antecedents on Organization-Public Relationships” In their article, Trent Seltzer and Nicole Lee extend the conceptual clarity of the notion of relational antecedents by offering a conceptual model of organization-public relationship (OPR) processing, while taking care to note that their study centers on OPR perceptions and is delimited to the empirical investigation of only a portion of the full conceptual model. Drawing on literature from motivated processing and perceived congruence, the authors integrate these concepts with extant OPR scholarship to assert that relational antecedents fall into two categories: Antecedents can be distal, such as those that motivate the initiation of relationships, or proximal, such as those that cultivate and manage relationships after they are established. The authors empirically investigate five types of potential motivations for people to initiate a relationship with an organization: perceived social and/or cultural expectations, perceived expectations of valued others, perceived need for resources, perceived need for risk reduction, and perceived legal obligation to associate (cf. Broom, Casey, & Ritchey, 1997, 2000). The findings point to the importance of perceptions of social/cultural expectations in initiating the establishment of relationships between individuals and the various focal organizations studied, regardless of organization type. In addition, this study’s finding that “perceived value congruence accounted for the most unique variance” (p. x) in OPR perceptions poses interesting questions for future scholars. For example, given the importance of value congruence as suggested by this study, research on corporate social values and corporate social responsibility would benefit from thoughtful consideration of those concepts as potential distal antecedents to OPRs. I would also love to see future research implementing the suggestion of Seltzer and Lee (2018) to “consider the lifespan of an OPR” (p. x). After all, if relationships can be initiated, can’t they be terminated? “Hierarchical Consistency of Strategies in Image Repair Theory: PR Practitioners’ Perceptions of Effective and Preferred Crisis Communication Strategies” The article by Denise P. Ferguson, J. D. Wallace, and Robert C. Chandler examines the message strategies propounded by Benoit’s (1995, 1997) image repair theory (IRT) for organizations to use in responding to crises. The authors also provide a solid overview of Coombs (2007) situational crisis communication theory, which connects the IRT strategies for organizational responses in crises to three clusters of situation types differentiated by the extent to which publics attribute responsibility for the crisis to the organization: victim cluster, accidental cluster, and preventable cluster. The piece also reminds scholars of more recent scholarship (e.g., Kim & Sung, 2014) recommending that all organizations facing crisis management provide instructing and adjusting information (i.e., a base response), before selecting reputation management responses. This study contributes to public relations theory by its explicit inclusion of silence as a message response strategy and its finding that silence was least or second-to-least likely to be recommended by practitioners as a message response strategy. The findings also were interesting in the apparent stability of rankings of practitioners’ perceptions of the effectiveness of crisis response strategies across three scenarios, thus begging the question of whether the situational crisis communication theory remains relevant in its emphasis on the situational. That said, it’s also possible that these results were the product of a relatively limited set of three crisis scenarios. Nevertheless, the study’s findings suggest that scholars examining the motivations for crisis responses should look less at ethical or motivational concerns and more at pragmatic reasons why practitioners choose and recommend the use of specific crisis response strategies. Methodologically, the authors used the membership list of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) as their sampling frame, which reflects similar approaches to data collection done in the past on public relations practitioners. Yet, obtaining permission to use membership lists from professional associations has become increasingly difficult, and the limitations of this method—as noted by the authors—are real. Prior research has shown demographic differences between PRSA organizational membership and the population of those claiming to practice public relations in the United States, as documented by census data (e.g., Hazleton & Sha, 2012). I support the authors’ call for shorter survey instruments and also encourage the incorporation of attention-check items in longer questionnaires, to prevent potentially rote selection of answer options by fatigued respondents.",academic_research,"Editor’s essay: From anxiety to actionThe articles in this issue illustrate various reasons why people may feel anxious or stressed: societal changes, health concerns, social activism, relationships, crises, etc. In short, today’s world appears to offer no shortage of opportunities to feel anxious.

The article offers Dillard and Anderson (2004) to justify the summative indexing of emotions and Dean, Brandes, and Dharwadkar (1998) to support the notion of cynicism as multidimensional. Extending public relations theory into non-English-language terrain, the authors also discuss the connotative distinctions between two related terms in the Korean language: So-Tong (communication) and Dae-Wha (dialogue). What can English-language scholarship in public relations learn from these distinctive Korean words? What are the theoretical implications of exploring English-language-grounded concepts in a non-English language (cf. Sha, 2017)? I look forward to future studies shedding light on these questions. “The Influence of Distal Antecedents on Organization-Public Relationships” In their article, Trent Seltzer and Nicole Lee extend the conceptual clarity of the notion of relational antecedents by offering a conceptual model of organization-public relationship (OPR) processing, while taking care to note that their study centers on OPR perceptions and is delimited to the empirical investigation of only a portion of the full conceptual model. Drawing on literature from motivated processing and perceived congruence, the authors integrate these concepts with extant OPR scholarship to assert that relational antecedents fall into two categories: Antecedents can be distal, such as those that motivate the initiation of relationships, or proximal, such as those that cultivate and manage relationships after they are established. The authors empirically investigate five types of potential motivations for people to initiate a relationship with an organization: perceived social and/or cultural expectations, perceived expectations of valued others, perceived need for resources, perceived need for risk reduction, and perceived legal obligation to associate (cf. Broom, Casey, & Ritchey, 1997, 2000). The findings point to the importance of perceptions of social/cultural expectations in initiating the establishment of relationships between individuals and the various focal organizations studied, regardless of organization type. In addition, this study’s finding that “perceived value congruence accounted for the most unique variance” (p. x) in OPR perceptions poses interesting questions for future scholars. For example, given the importance of value congruence as suggested by this study, research on corporate social values and corporate social responsibility would benefit from thoughtful consideration of those concepts as potential distal antecedents to OPRs. I would also love to see future research implementing the suggestion of Seltzer and Lee (2018) to “consider the lifespan of an OPR” (p. x). After all, if relationships can be initiated, can’t they be terminated? “Hierarchical Consistency of Strategies in Image Repair Theory: PR Practitioners’ Perceptions of Effective and Preferred Crisis Communication Strategies” The article by Denise P. Ferguson, J. D. Wallace, and Robert C. Chandler examines the message strategies propounded by Benoit’s (1995, 1997) image repair theory (IRT) for organizations to use in responding to crises. The authors also provide a solid overview of Coombs (2007) situational crisis communication theory, which connects the IRT strategies for organizational responses in crises to three clusters of situation types differentiated by the extent to which publics attribute responsibility for the crisis to the organization: victim cluster, accidental cluster, and preventable cluster. The piece also reminds scholars of more recent scholarship (e.g., Kim & Sung, 2014) recommending that all organizations facing crisis management provide instructing and adjusting information (i.e., a base response), before selecting reputation management responses. This study contributes to public relations theory by its explicit inclusion of silence as a message response strategy and its finding that silence was least or second-to-least likely to be recommended by practitioners as a message response strategy. The findings also were interesting in the apparent stability of rankings of practitioners’ perceptions of the effectiveness of crisis response strategies across three scenarios, thus begging the question of whether the situational crisis communication theory remains relevant in its emphasis on the situational. That said, it’s also possible that these results were the product of a relatively limited set of three crisis scenarios. Nevertheless, the study’s findings suggest that scholars examining the motivations for crisis responses should look less at ethical or motivational concerns and more at pragmatic reasons why practitioners choose and recommend the use of specific crisis response strategies. Methodologically, the authors used the membership list of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) as their sampling frame, which reflects similar approaches to data collection done in the past on public relations practitioners. Yet, obtaining permission to use membership lists from professional associations has become increasingly difficult, and the limitations of this method—as noted by the authors—are real. Prior research has shown demographic differences between PRSA organizational membership and the population of those claiming to practice public relations in the United States, as documented by census data (e.g., Hazleton & Sha, 2012). I support the authors’ call for shorter survey instruments and also encourage the incorporation of attention-check items in longer questionnaires, to prevent potentially rote selection of answer options by fatigued respondents."

2019,1&2,Bey-Ling Sha,Editor’s essay: committing to community,"Community and public relations research The idea that public relations and community are connected concepts can be traced to Kruckeberg and Starck’s (1988) book, which argued that “public relations is best defined and practiced as the active attempt to restore and maintain a sense of community” (Kruckeberg & Starck, 2004, p. 136). Furthermore, Hallahan (2004) believed that “community” was a promising conceptual foundation to further develop both public relations theory and public relations practice. He defined community as “any group that shares common interests developed through common experience” (p. 243). Hallahan (2004) not only offered a helpful overview of “community” as defined in various disciplines, but also noted wisely that those definitions could be placed on a “continuum from purely geographic communities to purely symbolic communities” (p. 235). Similarly, Underwood and Frey (2007) noted that “community” can be conceptualized using not only physical attributes, but also psychological ones, echoing the work of earlier scholars (e.g., Hillery, 1955; McMillan & Chavis, 1986). Today, contemporary technologies such as digital media have shifted the focus of community toward the symbolic end of the continuum, in that “communities” are less geographically based and more digitally gathered (e.g., Toledano & Maplesden, 2016; Valentini, Kruckeberg, & Starck, 2012). In this context, physical parameters for a given community become less important than psychological parameters, which include a sense of belonging as one marker of a sense of community (cf. Bernstein & Norwood, 2008). Ultimately, the recommendations from Kruckeberg and Starck (1988) for how public relations can contribute to a sense of community remain on point: “helping community members and their organizations become conscious of common interests; helping individuals in the community to overcome alienation; helping individuals find security and protection through association with others; actively taking part in community projects promoting progress; and helping foster personal friendships” (Valentini et al., 2012, p. 875). Community among public relations scholars My own introduction to the public relations academic community began of course with my mentors and professors, including Dick Crable, Steve Vibbert, and Krishnamurthy Sriramesh at Purdue; then Lauri Grunig, Jim Grunig, and Linda Hon at Maryland; followed by my mentors and colleagues Glen Broom and David Dozier at San Diego State. At my very first academic conference presentation, the paper discussant was Dean Kruckeberg, and the only audience member (because it was an 8 a.m. session? Because the presenters were a bunch of unknown master’s degree students?) was Bob Heath. Without question, I got a great introduction to the community of public relations scholars. My sense of community has only grown over the years as I had opportunities to attend more conferences, to get to know more public relations scholars, and to contribute in my turn to growing and strengthening our community. Research shows that one’s psychological sense of community can be predicted by how long one expects to be part of the community, one’s satisfaction with the community, and the number of people one knows in the community (Glynn, 1981). “Glynn also found a positive relationship between sense of community and the ability to function competently in the community” (McMillan & Chavis, 1986, p. 6). Community for public relations scholarship Guided by prior research, my personal experiences, and the precepts espoused by Kruckeberg and Starck (1988, Valentini et al., 2012), I offer here some concrete suggestions for how we might demonstrate a commitment to maintaining a sense of community among public relations scholars to the benefit of public relations scholarship: Attend conference sessions. I am sure many of us have experienced situations in which a conference session had more presenters in the room than non-presenting attendees. Having the privilege and the means to attend academic conferences comes with the responsibility of supporting the academic community with our very presence, including time-limit-respecting presentations, non-self-focused paper responses, and respectful discussions relevant to the session. Meet each other. While this is every introvert’s nightmare, meeting people face-to-face or even online can decrease one’s sense of isolation and increase one’s sense of community. I applaud the efforts by our academic associations to introduce graduate students to senior scholars and to offer mentoring opportunities to all community members, because these activities strengthen our common interests and enhance our sense of togetherness. Submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. The dissemination of research results is a standard part of the scientific method (cf. Wimmer & Dominick, 2014), and scientific journals typically have offered one means of sharing knowledge. While the oligopoly of big publishers has been appropriately scrutinized for their powerful influence on research communities (cf. Larivière, Haustein, & Mongeon, 2015a, 2015b), the reality remains that the relationship between publisher and the published is a symbiotic one, in which each party needs the other to contribute to our collective sense of community. Review manuscripts for academic journals. Academic publishing is a community project, and peer review is a function expected of competent community members. The challenges experienced by journal editors to find qualified, available, and willing manuscript reviewers are real, and the sense of professional satisfaction experienced by reviewers who take their duty seriously and execute it well is profound. So, if community is defined and created at least in part by how one feels about a group to which one belongs, then perhaps the only community that exists in reality is in fact that which is perceptual. If this is true, then the concrete actions each of us undertakes in service to each other in this community of public relations scholars are important choices indeed. Growth of public relations research networks: A bibliometric analysis Eyun-Jung Ki, Yorgo Pasadeos, and Tugce Ertem Eray present a bibliometric analysis of scholarship in public relations from a six-year publication period, beginning in 2010 and ending in 2015. First, the analysis offers insight into how scholarship in public relations has evolved over time by examining published work in the Public Relations Review, the Journal of Public Relations Research (previously the Public Relations Research Annual), and the Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly (previously the Journalism Quarterly). Second, the article expands the scope of introspective research (cf. Pavlik, 1987) on scholarly communication in public relations, by also providing an analysis of work published in three additional journals founded with the intention of being more international in perspective: International Journal of Strategic Communication, Journal of Communication Management, and Corporate Communication: An International Journal. The authors also offer strong arguments for the value of bibliometric analysis, which include illuminating not only patterns of publication and of influence, but also the status of topical areas and scholarly paradigms. Encouraging signs from the time period studied regarding the trajectory of public relations scholarship include an increase in the number of citations of refereed journal articles, as well as an increase in the number of citations of journals outside the field of public relations. I support the authors’ suggestion that existing theories in the areas of crisis communication, relationship management, new technologies, and dialogic communication might be saturated and that “[i]t might be time for researchers in these areas to bring new perspectives from which to develop new theories or frameworks” (p. x). I would also encourage continued scholarly reflection and deep thinking on ways to differentiate key terms used in our field, many of which would benefit from robust explication (cf. Chaffee, 1991). Engaged at work? An employee engagement model in public relations This important article by Hongmei Shen and Hua Jiang offers a much-needed explication of the frequently used – but unclearly defined – concept of engagement, situated in the internal context. Defining “employee engagement as the enactment and presentation of employees’ selves at work” (pp.28-45), the authors acknowledge the three dimensions of employee engagement: physical, affective, cognitive. The article offers a nomological network for employee engagement, presenting a conceptual model that examines the antecedents and outcomes of this concept, what the authors term a “strategy-engagement-behavior model” (pp.28-45). Findings from the study demonstrate the importance of organization-initiated engagement strategies: openness, networking, and assurances of legitimacy. In other words, employees feel more highly engaged with their employers when they feel the organization is open with them (e.g., about organizational decision-making processes); when the organization builds networks with professional or community groups to the benefit of employees; and when the organization acknowledges employees’ concerns as legitimate and works to address those concerns. In terms of relational outcomes, highly engaged employees not only speak well of their employers to others both inside and outside the organization, but also volunteer helpful contributions beyond what is required by their jobs (i.e., contextual performance). These results provide practical help not only to public relations practitioners in their jobs, but also to public relations scholars seeking to create more engagement at their own universities. In particular, as public relations educators and practitioners move into leadership roles in their own or other organizations, this study offers theory-driven and evidence-based suggestions for engaging employees in the workplace in ways that encourage their contextual performance and their positive information-sharing efforts. Grounding twenty-first-century public relations praxis in Aristotelian ethos Sometimes, to move forward, we have to review and remember the past, which so frequently informs the present. To that end, the article by Dominic Maximilian Ofori begins with a careful distinction between public relations practice and public relations praxis, with the former being routine and unreflective (cf. Arnett & Arneson, 1999) and the latter being not only philosophically grounded, but also thoughtfully and reflectively executed (cf. Arnett & Arneson, 1999; Roberts, 2006). The essay weaves together threads from extant literature about public relations as rhetoric and the importance of speaker (i.e., organizational) credibility in the communication process to argue that the Aristotelian notion of speaker ethos (i.e., discursive character) can help to make public relations praxis more ethically responsible. Ofori further argues that this is best done when the component elements of Aristotelian ethos – good sense or expertise (phronesis), good moral character or virtue (arête), and goodwill or shared friendship (eunoia) – are understood and explicitly connected to public relations. I find this essay to offer two important reminders. First, whether a speaker (i.e., an organization) is credible lies in the judgment (i.e., krites) of audience members, who evaluate the extent to which the rhetor’s arguments align with their own interests (i.e., eudaimonia). This means that public relations scholars must do more to collect data from both organizations and their publics when studying organizational issues and crises. Second, if public relations practitioners are truly to function as professionally independent counselors (cf. PRSA Code of Ethics, 2000), then grounding our efforts in Aristotelian ethos may indeed further the “perspectival autonomy” that Ofori argues is possible with a sophisticated understanding and execution of phronesis, arête, and eunoia. This underscores that our discipline’s journey toward professionalism remains in progress, with continuous improvements both possible and necessary.",academic_research,"Editor’s essay: committing to communityCommunity and public relations research The idea that public relations and community are connected concepts can be traced to Kruckeberg and Starck’s (1988) book, which argued that “public relations is best defined and practiced as the active attempt to restore and maintain a sense of community” (Kruckeberg & Starck, 2004, p. 136).

Overall, this study found that public relations scholarship experienced quantitative and qualitative leaps during the last decade, and the areas of excellence theory, relationship management, and crisis communication were heavily researched across the journals examined, whereas stakeholder and corporate communication are major study areas in the international journals."
2019,1&2,Hongmei Shen & Hua Jiang,Engaged at work? An employee engagement model in public relations,"Engagement has emerged as an important concept in public relations scholarship. Yet a theoretically informed model with a clear and coherent explication of the construct is still lacking. By situating our study in the internal organizational context, we provided an updated conceptualization and operationalization of employee engagement, proposing a strategy-engagement-behavior three-step employee engagement model. Results from an employee survey (n = 568) supported our conceptual model, showing that organizational engagement strategies positively predicted employee engagement, which in turn accounted for employees’ positive and negative messaging behavior, as well as their contextual performance behavior. After controlling for significant demographic variables such as gender, age, organizational size, number of subordinates, and level of management position, we identified a complete mediation effect of employee engagement in our two-step structural equation modeling analysis.",academic_research,"Engaged at work?

This approach locates persuasion at the nexus of speaker ethos in the public relations process. It allows practitioners to balance their commitment to the ethics of their profession with loyalty to clients, while empowering audiences (organizations and their publics) to function as the final arbiters of any courses of action proposed to them. Moreover, because the approach enables practitioners, based on their credible ethos, to participate in organizational decision-making, it has the potential to transfer their ethical worldview to client organizations. Ultimately, the central theoretical contribution of this essay is an alternative approach to public relations praxis founded on an analysis of Aristotle’s notion of phronesis, arête, and eunoia.",academic_research,"Grounding Twenty-first-Century Public Relations Praxis in Aristotelian EthosBy grounding public relations praxis in Aristotelian ethos, practitioners can function as liaison officers with balanced perspectives, capable of co-creating meaning with both client organizations and their publics between whom experts are hired to facilitate mutually beneficial relationships.

Duthler,Public relations in the Middle East: an editorial introduction,"Although origins of public relations can be traced to ancient times in regions across the world, its academic study has been associated with twentieth century United States of America (Broom & Sha, 2013). Ethnocentricity characterizes much of public relations theorizing, which does not capture the broader gamut of the global enactment of public relations (Sriramesh & Vercic, 2009, 2019). This special issue aims to situate research in a non-Euro-American context and to offer richly textured, contextual understandings of public relations in the Middle East. A region steeped in history; one that gave the world its first system of writing; the cradle of three world religions; producer of a substantial share of world oil – the Middle East in recent times has gripped the world’s attention not only with issues of grave importance in conflict-ridden countries, but also with transformative economic growth, especially in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Significant political, economic, social, and cultural similarities and differences among countries in the region imply the need to examine specific contextual factors that could impact the practice of public relations in the region. The purpose of this introductory essay is to analyze and contextualize extant research in the Middle East using the global public relations framework (see Sriramesh & Vercic, 2009, 2019), introduce the articles in this issue, and to propose directions for future research. The global public relations framework considers culture fairly broadly to encompass political, economic, media, societal, organizational, and activist cultures. The framework not only highlights the importance of examining these variables, but also emphasizes the interconnections among them. This editorial introduction is structured as follows. We review the variables of the global public relations framework and contextualize public relations research in Middle Eastern countries within the framework, introduce the articles in this special issue, and suggest avenues for future research.",academic_research,"Public relations in the Middle East: an editorial introductionAlthough origins of public relations can be traced to ancient times in regions across the world, its academic study has been associated with twentieth century United States of America (Broom & Sha, 2013).

This study has both empirical and methodological objectives: a) to solve a built-in lacuna in on-going dialogue research that frequently addresses important aspects of PR and dialogue in a blended manner, thereby undercutting the ability to develop in-depth critical research and examine the issues of dialogue more comprehensively; b) to provide an empirical contribution to understanding dialogue within the context of political NGOs’ public relations in Israel’s divided society. We suggest a layered approach as a methodological solution to this void by introducing a Strata Approach to Dialogue Analysis (SADA). Israel’s divided society, comprising various opposing groups, serves as a case study to demonstrate the advantages of SADA over current analyzes of dialogue. By revealing the differences between dialogic potential (features), actual dialogue (process), and the perception of dialogue (orientation), SADA enables the development of in-depth, critical research, i.e. examining the issue of dialogue more accurately and comprehensively.",academic_research,"Introducing the Strata Approach to Dialogue Analysis (SADA): the case of political NGOs in IsraelWhile research on dialogue has been flourishing over the past few decades, critics contend that this scholarship often misses the core philosophical idea of dialogue, focusing instead on the absence or presence of dialogic principles in various organizational settings.

Drawing from two complementary approaches (relationship management and human resources management perspectives), the current study proposed a model of employee turnover intention as the ultimate negative outcome of the relationship quality that employees perceive to have developed with their organization, which is predicted by perceptions of organizational justice. Additionally, the current study incorporated employee job engagement as the mediator connecting the EOR with the turnover intention. The results of an in-person survey of 438 salespeople for a South Korean company revealed that organizational justice perceptions had a significant and direct influence on the EOR quality. The findings further revealed that high perceptions of organizational justice by employees affected job engagement, which in turn negatively influenced turnover intention.

This is particularly relevant for public relations today, as digital activism almost ubiquitously involves bringing together conflicting publics who are active and social media-savvy, meanwhile maintaining an organizational brand/mission. Using the 2017 Women’s March on Washington (WMW) as an object of study, we explored how campaign messages reflected principles of intersectionality, consensus- and dissensus-based communication, and organizational self-reflection. We conducted a thematic analysis of posts from the WMW’s social media accounts as well as media quotes by the organizational leaders to get at the leaders’ intentions in their message design. Data suggested that messages of inclusivity as well as of necessary discord were employed to enact political change for WMW’s publics. We argue that although the WMW was not wholly intersectional, particularly in determining its political agenda, the efforts toward intersectionality are notable for theory-building and reflective practice, particularly for social mediated campaigns. The study proposes a theory for digital intersectional communication to guide future research and advocacy work.",academic_research,"The problem of intersectionality as an approach to digital activism: the Women’s March on Washington’s attempt to unite all womenThis study examined the convergence of activism and intersectionality to understand how communicators create messages about social justice issues using social media.

Results of this study show a promising path to theorizing issues as contexts for identity contentions and organization-public relationships as identity connections. Results also suggest that individuals build connections with organizations to serve their self-definitional and self-enhancement needs.

By tracking the stances of each corporation and its activists longitudinally through content analysis, results generate the occurrence and changes of relationship modes over time. Findings show that COPR is equally applicable in both resolved and unresolved U.S. conflicts. Regardless of whether the problems were resolved or not, competing relationships occurred more frequently than cooperating relationships, which strengthens the argument that both parties maintain competing relationships for self-interests and may adopt strategies to achieve mutual benefits as well.

Most of the research on charisma to date is restricted to the area of leadership. In this article, however, charisma is generalized to take in all human beings and is conceptualized as a multi-dimensional cognitive-affective phenomenon. The article presents a pilot study aimed at providing an adequate operational definition of the construct as well as an initial tool for its measurement. A following literature review shows how authors have developed the concept of charisma and its initial operational dimensions for empirical research. A questionnaire is developed in three stages. The factor analyses applied in stages two and three point towards a six-factor solution (i.e. six dimensions of charisma). Further analysis reveals that the developed instrument is reliable and viable as well as applicable for future theoretical and practical work.",academic_review,"Generic charisma – Conceptualization and measurementIn these times, when fame is available to almost anyone, it is worth being able to measure the extent and dimensions of a person's charisma.

The key contributions of the paper include deepening and refocusing the theoretical foundations of crisis communication by experimentally analyzing the effects of traditional and social-media strategies on the recipients’ perceptions of reputation; and by analyzing the effects or crisis responses on the recipients’ secondary crisis communications (e.g., sharing information and leaving a message) and reactions (e.g., willingness to boycott).

The paper develops a theory driven model of the structural dimensions of reputation and analyzes organizational communication professionals’ views on the potential that online communication has for reputation management. The survey data showed that online communication was perceived to have positive impacts on the structure and advantages of reputation, and that these two aspects would seem to be strongly dependent on each other. Thus, online communication can be used to influence the assessments made by stakeholders about an organization's products and services, corporate responsibility, success, its ability to change and develop, and its public image. In addition, online communication can generate reputational advantages by strengthening stakeholder relationships and building social capital for the organization.",academic_review,"Meshworked reputation: Publicists’ views on the reputational impacts of online communicationThis paper discusses the conceptual and empirical connections between an organization's reputation management and online communication.

This outlook of occupational psyche casts a shadow over the bright prospect for media recognition of the profession. Journalists’ problems operate outside media relations, thus beyond direct attempts of public relations practitioners at media recognition via enhancing professionalism in their practices. There have been, however, only a few qualitative studies on this significant issue, all pointing to journalists’ occupational psyche running against media recognition. The purpose of this study is to determine quantitatively whether journalists’ own job satisfaction and their envy of public relations practitioners lead to their negative attitude. A survey of 128 Korean off-line journalists was conducted, and its results suggested that occupational psyche has little influence on media attitude—contrary to the findings of previous qualitative studies. For future study, this paper issues a call for cross-country, comparative research on the subject of journalists’ occupational psyche.",academic_review,"Are ‘journalists’ own problems’ aggravating their hostility toward public relations?—A study of Korean journalistsJournalists’ own job problems have been found to be detrimental to media recognition of public relations: journalists vent frustration from their worsening job conditions at public relations practitioners.

2011,3,Tom Watson,An initial investigation on the use of ‘Return on Investment” in public relations practice,"‘Return on Investment’ (ROI) is usually defined in management and marketing literature as a measure of financial effectiveness that is concerned with the returns on capital employed in business (profit-making) activities. In public relations practice, however, ROI appears to be used in a much looser form to indicate the results of activity. This quantitative research using an online survey instrument investigated practitioner understanding of the term, primarily in the UK, with the aim of preparing a benchmark on their understanding of the ROI concept and usage of ROI as a measurement of the effectiveness of public relations activity. These findings resulted: (1) two-thirds of PR practitioners regularly use the term ROI when planning and evaluating communication activity; (2) ROI is related mainly to communication objectives (66.7%) which are more widely used than financially related ROIs (12.8%); (3) there is a clear difference in ROI practices between consultants/freelances and in-house colleagues. Nearly three-quarters of consultants and freelances (73.1%) offered an ROI formula to clients but only 26.3% of in-house practitioners have one; and (4) on the oft-discussed question of an industry-wide ROI formula, only 35.6% supported the proposition with 64.4% opposed. The survey also found that practitioner concepts of ROI are very narrowly expressed, mainly in relation to media outputs.",academic_review,"An initial investigation on the use of ‘Return on Investment” in public relations practice‘Return on Investment’ (ROI) is usually defined in management and marketing literature as a measure of financial effectiveness that is concerned with the returns on capital employed in business (profit-making) activities.

China's signing (in 2003) and ratifying (in 2005) the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) place it in a position to adopt some of the anti-smoking measures common in some developed nations. Even though the country's tobacco industry acknowledges publicly health concerns over its products, it engages in communication practices that are paradoxical, in that they circumvent public-health initiatives and the expanding regulatory regimes of product-risk reduction even as the government promotes tobacco use. That paradox calls for three public-policymaking proposals: to conduct more comprehensive, nationwide health-communication campaigns; to use legislation to reduce tobacco use; and to restructure the tobacco industry.",academic_review,"China's tobacco industry's communication practices: Paradoxes and proposals for public policymakingThe People's Republic of China's expanding tobacco-control efforts call for additional, urgent government action on two major fronts: (a) conducting comprehensive health-communication campaigns on the clinical and economic effects of tobacco use; and (b) requiring major policy changes in the (structural and administrative) relationships between the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) and the industry at large, that is, primarily, the China National Tobacco Company (CNTC).

Reporters also were more likely to use non-official technology sources, or citizen generated content, than official technology sources such as web-based news releases and statements.

An impending rockslide is expected to produce a tsunami in the fjord around Åknes in Norway. Waves may run up above sea level as high as 82 m or 269 ft. All residents (18 and older) of the four most threatened communities received a questionnaire to determine what they perceived to be useful risk information. Three hundred and eighty-two (43.6% of 875) responded. Results indicated that parents of children living within the tsunami risk zones perceived the risk information to be the most useful. Those who lived in communities that experienced a similar disaster in 1934 reported public meetings less useful than written or mediated information. Publics who lived in communities with such disaster history and those who were not parents posed special challenges in risk communication because they perceived information from the government agencies as lacking in usefulness. Therefore, committing the resources necessary to foster dialogues with a diversity of publics exposed to risk would be well served to fully understand the nature of risk communication responses, and to be able to save human lives.",academic_review,"Communicating risk to parents and those living in areas with a disaster historyThis study explored how publics respond to risk communication in high probability but time-indeterminate natural disaster situations when parts of the area have been involved in a similar disaster before.

Based on the on-line survey of 223 employees from a variety of companies in China, both dimensions of employee empowerment—feelings of competence and feelings of control—serve as positive predictors for organization–employee relationship.

We argue that exposing students to classes and techniques rooted in the rhetorical tradition can (1) help to prepare students for practice; (2) address criticism of the curriculum's limited functionalistic scope; (3) prepare students to both understand and interrogate public discourse generally. We establish the foundations of rhetoric's role in public relations and provide three pedagogical examples and classroom exercises, thus demonstrating the benefits of further incorporating this perspective into the public relations classroom.

Four days after the show, Gervais tried to respond to the backlash by appearing on Piers Morgan Tonight to defend his performance and to repair his image. Gervais employed a variety of image repair strategies: denial, evasion of responsibility, minimization, and mortification. He focused most attention on transcendence, inviting his audience to view the awards show and his performance as an artistic pursuit of truth and self-discovery. Ultimately, Gervais failed to adapt to his audience and failed to repair his image.",academic_review,"Hooray for Hollywood?

PR professionals are confronted with the swift rise of social media that forces practitioners to pay due and timely attention. They are not only excited about utilizing these tools together with conventional media, but are also excited about speaking directly to their publics and stakeholders without the involvement of any intermediaries. Through the perspective of UTAUT model, this paper examines the social media adoption of PR professionals in Turkey and how they employ social media tools both internally and externally. We employed a web-based questionnaire to 126 PR professionals who are members of the Turkish Public Relations Association. Findings reveal that Turkish PR professionals highly appreciate the importance of social media in recent PR practice. However, not all social media tools are equally adopted; e-mail is the most, and virtual world applications are the least adopted social media. It is also found that in the future, social networks are expected to be the most important social media, while corporate web sites get the second and mobile phone (PDA) applications get the third rank.",academic_review,"Social media adoption among Turkish public relations professionals: A survey of practitionersSocial media is emerging as an important public relations tool and empowers two way symmetrical communications with publics and stakeholders.

By building on a more advanced understanding of communication as process of social meaning construction that is embedded in networks of differential relations between different actors, it contributes to extend the perspective of first- and second-order agenda building towards a kind of “third order” or “network agenda building”. Via an automated content analysis of more than 3700 articles we examine agenda- and frame-differences between public relations, UK and US news in the BP crisis. The study documents that BP successfully applied a decoupling strategy: It dissociated itself from being responsible for the cause and at the same time presented itself as solvent of the crisis. It shows that in crises, associative frames in PR resonate partly to associative frames in news.

Therefore western allies in Iraq and Afghanistan are not only involved in a physical struggle but also in a struggle over perceptions, for no long-term engagement of troops is possible without support from home, nor can a counterinsurgency succeed without the support of the local population. While the ability to exert influence upon various relevant target groups – opponents, the local population and the home front – has always been crucially important during conflicts, with the more recent globalized media this has led to previously unknown potential opportunities to influence audiences. With the intermixing of target audiences and the successes achieved by terrorists in the field of communication, the importance of the ideological struggle has increased enormously. In this context the concept of strategic communication has become relevant, which refers to the consistency of strategy, activities, themes and messages, and the aim of obtaining legitimacy and support.

This paper analyzes the effect of the Spanish government's messaging in the face of the Madrid bombing of March 11, 2004: unlike what happened with the 9/11 bombings in the USA and the 7/07 London attacks, the Spanish media did not support the government's framing of the events. Taking framing as a strategic action in a discursive form (Pan & Kosicki, 2003), and in the context of the attribution theory of responsibilities, this research uses the “cascading activation” model (Entman, 2003, Entman, 2004) to explore how a framing contest was generated in the press. Analysis of the coverage shows that the intended government frame triggered a battle among the different major newspapers, leading editorials to shift their frame over the four days prior to the national elections. This research analyzes strategic contests in framing processes and contributes insight into the interactions among the different sides (government, parties, media, and citizens) to help bring about an understanding of the rebuttal effect of the government's intended frame.

The survey was conducted among the 367 largest private companies (selected from DK 1000, established by Børsen business magasin) and among 98 public organizations (municipalities). The overall goal was to get a preliminary idea of how these companies or organizations perceive, plan, coordinate and implement internal crisis management and crisis communication activities before, during and after a crisis. The survey questionnaire comprised 36 questions and was sent to respondents who typically are responsible for the crisis-preparedness of their organizations. The results from the survey show that the vast majority of organizations have a crisis or contingency plan, and most of these plans contain an internal dimension relating to the management and communication with the internal stakeholders during a crisis. Thus, the study shows a rather professional and formalized behavior towards crisis management in general, but also when it comes to managing a crisis in relation to the internal organizational stakeholders in specific. In addition, the results clearly indicate a strong relation between organizational size and crisis management; the larger the organization the more likely to have a crisis plan. This particularly pertained to the private organizations. The ICMCC survey forms part of a major collaborative research project, financed by the Danish Council for Independent Research/Social Sciences (2011–2014), entitled Internal Crisis Management and Crisis Communication in Danish Organizations.

This paper looks into how 73 nonprofit organizations use Twitter to engage stakeholders not only through their tweets, but also through other various communication methods. Specifically it looks into the organizations utilization of tweet frequency, following behavior, hyperlinks, hashtags, public messages, retweets, and multimedia files. After analyzing 4655 tweets, the study found that the nation's largest nonprofits are not using Twitter to maximize stakeholder involvement. Instead, they continue to use social media as a one-way communication channel as less than 20% of their total tweets demonstrate conversations and roughly 16% demonstrate indirect connections to specific users.",academic_review,"Engaging stakeholders through Twitter: How nonprofit organizations are getting more out of 140 characters or lessWhile it may seem difficult to communicate in a meaningful manner with 140 characters or less, Twitter users have found creative ways to get the most out of each Tweet by using different communication tools.

McAllister,How the world's top universities provide dialogic forums for marginalized voices,"Viewed through the lens of the dialogic theory of public relations, this study examines if universities use new media tools and how the world's top universities use Facebook as an interactive forum that give voice to key stakeholders. With the declining economy and limited access to resources, it is important to know how organizations utilize Web-based tools to build and maintain relationships at national and global levels. Because prior research found that users had negative feelings about lack of dialogue on college websites, it is also important to know whether universities are tapping into the dialogic potential. The content analyses of the websites and Facebook platforms show that more than half of the universities have Facebook pages. The results also show that users cannot post content or photos, or participate in discussions and wall posts. In essence, the voices of key stakeholders are being silenced via a media that is intended to provide open forums for dialogue.",academic_review,"How the world's top universities provide dialogic forums for marginalized voicesViewed through the lens of the dialogic theory of public relations, this study examines if universities use new media tools and how the world's top universities use Facebook as an interactive forum that give voice to key stakeholders.

In the early 2000s, under the Government of the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, there was some blurring of the lines between the role of impartial government communicators who were members of the Government Information and Communication Service (GICS) and politically appointed Special Advisors. In 1997, Alistair Campbell, Director of Communication, and Blair's Special Advisor, had been given the power to direct government communicators and subsequently there were a number of incidents that reinforced the view that propriety lines were being breached. It was felt that the GICS was being increasingly politicised. The Phillis Review led to far reaching change, the most important being the appointment of a Permanent Secretary, a civil servant of the most senior rank to lead GICS. The impact on the GICS was significant. It re-established its independence from political advisors, its numbers increased and it found a renewed confidence and role in Government and public life.

In the final 25 years of the century, the academic voice began to become more prominent in the discussion and development of methodologies and in nationally-based education programmes aimed at practitioners. The Internet and social media also began to change practices. There were mixed results from this clamour: more practitioners began to evaluate public relations activity (but many still applied discredited measures) whilst new techniques began to be introduced.

Opportunities for public relations to offer a career rather than simply a transitory job or occupation were identified. The potential for enhanced benefits, including greater income and higher social status, were noted as a result. However, despite evidence of the possibility of professional and bureaucratic career paths, public relations pioneers tended to reflect entrepreneurial, opportunistic and primarily commenda (agency) forms of career. Most early practitioners entered the field by chance revealing a lack of deliberate focus on seeking employment in the occupation. Their varying entry points suggest the concept of equifinality (whereby different routes may lead to the same end); although career progression for those employed in public relations support functions, and the experiences of women are largely undocumented.

Moreover, residents in recipient-regions still associate public relations with past electoral campaigns, while businesses see public relations as subordinated to advertising and marketing."
2012,3,N. Leila Trapp,Corporation as climate ambassador: Transcending business sector boundaries in a Swedish CSR campaign,"At a time when corporations are addressing increasingly complex, global corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues, this study examines and evaluates the strategies used in Vattenfall's challenging and innovative CSR campaign which aimed at establishing the energy company as a credible climate ambassador. Based on an analysis of the campaign outcomes in terms of the distinct interests and competencies of business, government and civil sector actors, I suggest that the company's credibility was weakened by its portrayal of Vattenfall as being more intent on organizing a public, collective action to fight climate change than on securing company-related business interests. Two ways to ensure greater credibility in similar cases are proposed: communicating explicitly about company motives for conducting CSR campaigns, and carrying out CSR campaigns in collaboration with non-profit organizations.",academic_review,"Corporation as climate ambassador: Transcending business sector boundaries in a Swedish CSR campaignAt a time when corporations are addressing increasingly complex, global corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues, this study examines and evaluates the strategies used in Vattenfall's challenging and innovative CSR campaign which aimed at establishing the energy company as a credible climate ambassador.

Following this perspective, we propose ethnography as a methodological imperative in public relations research that seeks to develop descriptive inferences about the influence of an organization's culture on its social ecology. The ethnographic imperative in research design is derived from two interlocked, epistemological commitments in research design. First, a view that the culture of an organization is constituted as a system of shared knowledge that is socially transmitted over time among organizational members. Second, as a consequence, the cognitive setting for actor-based models of organizational social relationships and imperatives is cultural in nature. Based on these commitments, ethnography as a methodological imperative is specifically enjoined when research derived from cocreational public relations theories is explicitly set in sociocultural analysis of those organizations.

The web 2.0 is generating significant changes in the manner that organizations engage in dialogue with their publics, opening the way towards the interactive communication. In this way, web 2.0 tools will foster the dialogic communication between museums and their publics. Through them, the relationship between museums and publics is changing towards more interactive and collaborative forms. The objective of this article is to assess the level of dialogic communication developed by museums on the Internet, by analyzing the use of web platforms and social web applications as tools for dialogic communication by 120 museums in Spain. Two key aspects of communication between museums and publics using the Internet were identified to that end: content management and interaction management. These aspects enable a matrix which makes a distinction between the phases of evolution of the institutional web communication. The results obtained show that the museums studied are predominantly in a phase of monologic communication with their publics.",academic_review,"Assessing dialogic communication through the Internet in Spanish museumsDialogic communication is being boosted by the strong development of the social web.

Strong relationships are what lead to donor engagement in a non-profit cause, and the participatory culture that grows online as a result of using Twitter can help to initiate and build relationships with online donors. In this research, tweets were collected from two non-profit organizations, Care2 and United Way Toronto, and one for-profit corporation, Ford Motor Company. The textual construction of the tweets was analyzed using discourse analysis and a rhetorical framework as methodologies. Two main communication theories – the Social-Judgement Theory and the Social Networking Theory – emerged from the analyzed data and were driving forces behind the results. When applied to the data, it was evident that both these theories supported and illustrated ways to build and strengthen relationships using the social media tool, Twitter.",academic_review,"Donor engagement through TwitterThis research examines how non-profit organizations can build and strengthen relationships with donors using the social media tool Twitter.

However, an increase in the number of medals collected during the two Olympics by developing countries did not benefit national image. Agenda setting theorizes that only a few top agendas can successfully draw attention from the public. National image is a very stable perception built by macro and long-term factors.

2012,5,Joanne Chen Lyu,A comparative study of crisis communication strategies between Mainland China and Taiwan: The melamine-tainted milk powder crisis in the Chinese context,"The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to identify and compare the crisis communication strategies (CCSs) that organizations used to respond to a congenetic melamine-tainted milk crisis in two Chinese societies (i.e., Mainland China and Taiwan), and (2) to explore the underlying political and media system reasons that led to the differences. Content analysis and discourse analysis of media coverage were used. The most significant finding is that Sanlu (a Mainland China-based organization) and KingCar (a Taiwan-based organization) demonstrated inverse pattern of the CCS adoption. Specifically, according to Coombs’ (1998) defense-accommodation continuum, Sanlu's CCSs moved from defensive to accommodative pole as time went by whereas, in contrast, KingCar started with accommodative strategies and moved towards the defensive pole gradually. Besides, the results showed that both organizations adopted denial, corrective action and apology strategies. However, on the Sanlu part, the most frequently used strategy was denial, while KingCar used justification most often. Moreover, this paper suggests that besides cultural dynamics, political and media systems also play a part in corporate selection of CCSs, and they are among the most important factors that should be taken into account to explain the differences in societies even with an identical traditional culture.",academic_review,"A comparative study of crisis communication strategies between Mainland China and Taiwan: The melamine-tainted milk powder crisis in the Chinese contextThe purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to identify and compare the crisis communication strategies (CCSs) that organizations used to respond to a congenetic melamine-tainted milk crisis in two Chinese societies (i.e., Mainland China and Taiwan), and (2) to explore the underlying political and media system reasons that led to the differences.

A case study of the Danish government's response to the so-called Cartoon Crisis illustrates how the threat from international terrorism to national security initially served as a catalyst for new public diplomacy initiatives. But as the initiatives were implemented within a framework of nation branding the focus on risk reduction became subjected to a marketing logic and a new focus on economic objectives took over. The paper points to a possible future status of public diplomacy under the influence of nation branding: Public diplomacy may maintain a function pertinent to national security but as this function is incapable of managing real risks it will only serve as auto-communication that legitimizes security policy towards a domestic audience.

This paper argues that the central ethical tension facing public relations as a field lies in its divided ethical identity, in particular between the idealized codes of conduct influenced by the US-based excellence project, which conjure images of wise counsel balancing duties to client and society, and practitioner-led expectations that they are advocates and should privilege clients over society. The paper touches on the wider context of professional ethics in the early 21st century from western and non-western perspectives, in order to frame current debates in public relations’ ethics. Taking a Jungian approach, it suggests that the saint/sinner models represent opposing aspects of an ethical identity or archetype which can only be resolved through self-acceptance and a willingness to embrace contradiction.",academic_review,"Saints and sinners: Competing identities in public relations ethicsPublic relations ethics is confused and often superficial in its approach, relying heavily on traditional theory, with only occasional reference to more recent developments in professional ethics, particularly feminist and global ethical perspectives.

In the organization-public relationship, people may not show the same mercy to the organization as they do to other people."

This article builds on the work of Taylor and Doerfel (2005), who advocated for the continued study of civil society through the lens of public relations theory. This study contributes to a normative public relations model of civil society by examining how interorganizational relationships, which may initially be established for purposes of resource exchange, benefit civil society through the creation and maintenance of social capital. The study examined a segment of Peruvian civil society dedicated to media development, as media is a key partner in building civil society (Taylor, 2009). The results of the study help to explain how interorganizational relationships contribute to the creation of social capital in a civil society network, and how certain network positions are integral to maintaining the social capital of a community of actors. Implications for the role of public relations in building and maintaining networks of interorganizational communities are discussed.",academic_review,"Networks of social capital: Extending a public relations model of civil society in PeruScholars have argued that public relations can and indeed must be used to improve society.

Given the participatory and communal nature of SNSs, this study proposed a conceptual model incorporating social media dependency and several social relationship factors, including parasocial interaction, perceived source credibility, and community identification, that influenced Chinese publics’ engagement with companies on SNSs. We conducted a web survey with a random sample of 245 Chinese SNS users to test the proposed model.

However, classical crisis communication theories neglect the role of the medium and focus mainly on the interplay between crisis type and crisis communication strategy. Building on the recently developed “networked crisis communication model” we contrast effects of medium (Facebook vs. Twitter vs. online newspaper) and crisis type (intentional vs. victim) in an online experiment. Using the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster as crisis scenario, we show that medium effects are stronger than the effects of crisis type. Crisis communication via social media resulted in a higher reputation and less secondary crisis reactions such as boycotting the company than crisis communication in the newspaper. However, secondary crisis communication, e.g. talking about the crisis communication, was higher in the newspaper condition than in the social media conditions because people consider traditional media as more credible. We also found higher levels of anger in the intentional crisis condition than in the victim crisis condition. Anger in turn was related to reputation, secondary crisis communication and secondary crisis reaction.

Not only do individuals and organizations communicate differently during a crisis, but they are also perceived very differently; social media platforms and messages add to the challenges involved in maintaining the overall reputation of brands and corporations. To better understand the new messaging system and its effects, the researchers analyzed social media crisis messages and messaging theory through various qualitative and quantitative value modeling techniques and generated a simple baseline model for what constitutes a “good” crisis message. Using data collected during Hurricane Irene, the researchers used this baseline model to rank effective and ineffective messages to determine whether the most followed/forwarded messages fit this model, and to identify a set of new best practices for crisis communicators and reputation management monitors using social media platforms.",academic_review,"Using value modeling to evaluate social media messages: The case of Hurricane IreneEmerging technologies, advances in social media, and new communication platforms have transformed how crisis communicators reach their audiences and partner agencies in a variety of situations.

Once disseminated, even baseless accusations can persist and cause considerable damage for a company. This study examines the proactive crisis communication strategy of inoculating individuals against invalid accusations before they go viral. An experiment was conducted in a real world consumer context among members of an online consumer panel using an electronics discounter as the research stimulus. Expanding previous inoculation research on the role of value-relevant involvement for inoculation and the effectiveness of inoculation in the case of different preexisting attitudes, we find that consumers’ identification with a company moderates inoculation effectiveness. Consumers strongly opposing or disidentifying with the company under attack reported fewer negative beliefs and attitude change as well as fewer intentions to spread the accusation after being exposed to an inoculation message refuting the claim against the company. Consumers strongly identifying with the company, on the other hand, did not profit from such an inoculation. Their level of identification alone was sufficient to prevent attitude slippage. Implications for public relations research and practice are discussed.",academic_review,"Countering accusations with inoculation: The moderating role of consumer-company identificationAccusations of wrongdoing, baseless or justified, can severely tarnish a company's reputation.

In addition, a product is viewed more positively by an audience receiving information quoting a customer spokesperson rather than a company spokesperson. An audience with low business expertise considers both types of spokespersons as more trustworthy than a high-expertise audience; however, a customer is considered more trustworthy than a company spokesperson.

This study analyzes Clinton's attempts in debate performances to repair her image among voters. Clinton attempted to reduce offensiveness through differentiation, attempted to evade responsibility through defeasibility, and employed qualified mortification. Clinton's strategies were rated as inconsistent and their effectiveness is questionable.",academic_review,"An inconvenient vote: Hillary Clinton's Iraq war image repair debate strategies and their implications for representative democracyHillary Rodham Clinton was one of four 2007–2008 Democratic presidential candidates who had voted to authorize U.S. military use in Iraq.

These government communication channels are often regarded to promote democratic values and public trust in government by helping the government provide the public with information and respond to citizen inquires. Further, such channels help the public provide the government with feedback. This study questions whether individuals’ experience with government websites and social media do, in fact, influence their perception of the government-public relationship (represented by public trust in government). The results, which are based on a nationwide survey of more than 2000 American citizens, showed support for a positive relationship between this online experience and public trust in government. In particular, experiences with informational online services and social media were associated with greater trust in government at the local and state levels, while those with transactional online services conveyed greater trust in the federal government.

Elite, in-depth conversations with 19 senior executives at 16 companies in India well known for their CSR initiatives revealed that practitioners appeared to be both organizational activists and agents. As organizational activists, they acknowledged the existence of diverse voices in local communities, interjected these voices into management discourse, situated decision-making in local contexts, identified tensors in the relationship between the corporation and its publics, and negotiated new meanings through dissensus. Paradoxically, as organizational agents, they used these participatory, open processes of dialogic communication to shape public opinion in favour of the organization, feeding modern organizations’ proclivity for consensus. While the findings of the study support the postmodern conceptualization of the public relations practitioner as an organizational activist in the context of CSR and community relations, the agent aspect of the activist-agent dialectic problematizes and complicates this conceptualization thus enhancing understandings of the postmodern practitioner who enacts CSR within a modernist framework and navigates the intricacies of the activist-agent dialectic in their daily performance of building community relations and enabling democratic processes.",academic_review,"Building communities: The postmodern CSR practitioner as a dialectical activist-agent in IndiaThis study examined the conceptualization of the postmodern public relations practitioner as an organizational activist who contributes to democratic processes in the context of community relations and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in India.

The Today for Tomorrow program included the implementation of over 70 small changes that improved the efficiency of an experimental production line (e.g., magnifying glasses, stretching station, wooden floors, and ergonomic standing chairs). Several texts were analyzed including media stories, the organizational website, and the BMW Sustainability Report. Based on this case study, BMW's Today for Tomorrow program contained two overarching frames that aided in the attempt to highlight its age appropriate workplace initiatives. These frames are age as a valuable resource and BMW as a responsible organization. In addition, BMW incorporated both episodic (specific examples) and thematic (general context) framing techniques in order to localize and globalize the issue of an aging workforce simultaneously."

They focus on solving problems for the current generation rather than future generations, and they promote their actions (doing more) rather than promote their conservation (taking less from the earth).

However, as an ever more dominant context for communication management, IMC presents opportunities for public relations scholarship's contributions to the discipline, in spite of IMC's recognized threats. This article, which outlines the state of the fields of IMC and public relations literature, proposes the way public relations roles in relationship cultivation and organizational behavior uniquely contribute to IMC, and, at the same time, establish management roles for public relations. This article also addresses three challenges facing public relations research in integration by providing a better definition of IMC, establishing relationship cultivation as a critical point in the theoretical convergence of public relations and IMC, and providing a framework through which to conceptualize communication structures.",academic_review,"The public relations contribution to IMC: Deriving opportunities from threats and solidifying public relations’ futureIntegrated Marketing Communication (IMC) has been regarded primarily as a marketing concept.

This study examines the process by which this alignment is sought by CSR managers in the CSR strategy-making process. Through reliance on stakeholder management theories, and with a particular focus on how and why managers communicate with stakeholders, the extent to which the company-stakeholder alignment process in CSR strategy-making reflects modern, enlightened approaches to stakeholder relations is assessed. This assessment is based on an analysis of structured, in-depth interviews with CSR managers from sixteen industry-leading, Danish companies. The managers’ descriptions of their interactions with stakeholders reveal that their practices fall short of the normative, theoretical ideals since their focus is primarily on just listening to others in the strategy-making process rather than directly involving others in decision-making. Also, because non-stakeholders, such as paid-for consultants, are found to be note-worthy influencers in the CSR strategy-making process, it is concluded that the process is not only a stakeholder management exercise, but an expert, institutionalized, strategic issues management exercise as well.",academic_review,"Stakeholder involvement in CSR strategy-making?

2014,1,James Pamment,"Articulating influence: Toward a research agenda for interpreting the evaluation of soft power, public diplomacy and nation brands","While the terms soft power, public diplomacy (PD) and nation brands have cemented their place in academic discourse during the early 21st century, the evaluation of these activities has not been given anywhere near the same level of attention. When describing how campaigns are evaluated, scholars tend to make assumptions based on the goals or outputs of an initiative rather than on the basis of reliable, empirical data on its results. Strong positivist tendencies within current scholarship usually lead to evaluation being considered in terms of methodology and best practice, typically with the assumption that certain preferred outcomes will be demonstrable if an ideal model is followed. Most significantly, such approaches seem to underplay the interests and objectives that inform and constrain choices surrounding modes of communication and evaluation. I argue here that PD activities are rarely the product of rational choices about communication options, and nor is PD evaluation the result of applying the “best” methodology. Rather, questions of PD and evaluation practices are bound together in complex organizational and power structures that generate pragmatic responses both to the “problem of influence” and the reporting of results. Through use of the concept of articulation, this article outlines a framework for interpreting evaluation practices from a contextualized perspective, which grasps how and why soft power practices assume certain forms.",academic_review,"Articulating influence: Toward a research agenda for interpreting the evaluation of soft power, public diplomacy and nation brandsWhile the terms soft power, public diplomacy (PD) and nation brands have cemented their place in academic discourse during the early 21st century, the evaluation of these activities has not been given anywhere near the same level of attention.

Three types of stressors are identified as sources of work-life conflict: behavior-driven, work-driven, and life-driven. According to our findings, while behavior-driven work-life stressors are associated with proactive coping strategies such as rational action and positive thinking, work-driven stressors tended to trigger more avoidance. Non-work driven stressors seem to predict more passive coping tendencies, such as denial and avoidance. Organizational factors are found to be important in understanding how practitioners cope with work-life conflict. As organizational demands increased to separate life from work, more instructions seemed necessary for employees to better cope with work-life conflicts.

Integrated Reporting, as mandated by the King III Report seeks to combine the reporting of financial and nonfinancial performance measures in a way that promotes corporate strategy. South Africa is leading the way in corporate governance and financial reporting with the first large-scale adoption of Integrated Reporting by listed companies. While there is a marked increase in financial communication from companies, it is not clear how all stakeholders use and value this information. The primary aim of this paper was to investigate how financial information is consumed within the ambit of the new financial reporting standards. Through a national online survey, this study found that very few stakeholders use the Integrated Reports as their main source of financial and investment information, and that these reports are seen as additional information. Annual and interim financial reports by companies are still the mainstay for corporate financial information. While stakeholders currently seldom use the Internet for financial information, they have indicated that they would increasingly prefer to do so. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and challenges that future Integrated Reporting faces based on these findings.",academic_review,"Is Integrated Reporting the silver bullet of financial communication?

While there is a marked increase in financial communication from companies, it is not clear how all stakeholders use and value this information. The primary aim of this paper was to investigate how financial information is consumed within the ambit of the new financial reporting standards. Through a national online survey, this study found that very few stakeholders use the Integrated Reports as their main source of financial and investment information, and that these reports are seen as additional information. Annual and interim financial reports by companies are still the mainstay for corporate financial information. While stakeholders currently seldom use the Internet for financial information, they have indicated that they would increasingly prefer to do so. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and challenges that future Integrated Reporting faces based on these findings."
2014,2,"Pat Maubane, Andre Prinsloo, Nadia Van Rooyen",Sustainability reporting patterns of companies listed on the Johannesburg securities exchange,"The demand by stakeholders for information about companies’ social and environmental performance has led to sustainability reporting becoming essential. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines are the international reporting standard whereas the Johannesburg Securities Exchange Socially Responsible Investment (JSE SRI) Index guidelines are used in South Africa. Although South Africa is regarded as one of the leaders in sustainability reporting in the world, the JSE SRI Index is still a relatively new standard and its efficiency will only be proved over time. The research on which this paper is based, determined whether reporting patterns exist across specific market sectors of the sustainability reports of companies listed on the JSE in order to establish if the JSE SRI Index guidelines on reporting are efficient. Results indicated that all the selected market sectors reported on the environment, society and governance (ESG) categories as per requirements of the JSE SRI Index. The mining and materials sector reported more in the environment and the society categories than the other sectors, while in the governance category less reporting on indirect impacts by all the sectors was noted. The implication of this is that in general, companies find the JSE SRI Index guidelines on reporting easy to implement. However, less reporting of companies’ indirect impacts on their operating environments could mean that there is still a lack of completeness and transparency from the companies’ reports, which could be as a result of a lack of firmer guidelines by the JSE SRI Index guidelines on reporting of such issues.",academic_review,"Sustainability reporting patterns of companies listed on the Johannesburg securities exchangeThe demand by stakeholders for information about companies’ social and environmental performance has led to sustainability reporting becoming essential.

However, no study has provided a comprehensive prioritised list of all these variables in order to describe the practitioner that contributes to organisational performance. In light of this problem, this study tries to describe the South African public relations practitioner that will be able to contribute to organisational performance. The study firstly prioritises and tests all the variables influencing practitioners listed in literature against the views of South African practitioners in top performing organisations. Secondly the study, through the use of structural equation modelling, builds a model that describes the variables pertaining to a South African practitioner that contribute to organisational performance, from the view of South African practitioners. The study is framed within the relational, reflective, two-way symmetrical and feminist paradigms, supported by the general excellence theory as meta-theory, and the relationship management and corporate communication role theories. The multidimensional paradigm was specifically selected to accommodate the complex research context (Grunig, 1989, Grunig, 2006a, Valin, 2004).

2014,2,Lida Holtzhausen,Non-profit organizations bridging the communication divide in a complex South Africa,"South Africa's post-apartheid governments have made remarkable progress in consolidating the nation's peaceful transition to democracy, but many South Africans still view themselves and each other according to stigmatizing categories. As the country's remarkable and peaceful transition to democracy unfolds, millions, both urban and rural, are still confronted with having to survive unemployment, homelessness, lack of basic services, HIV/Aids, food insecurity and unacceptable levels of crime and violence. Confronted by the complexity of our development challenges, one of our biggest failures is a lack of communication, trust, common purpose, collaborative leadership and sustainable relationships between the various sectors and stakeholders in development. Transforming South Africa's society to remove the legacy of marginalization will be a long-term process requiring the sustained commitment of the leaders and people of the nation's diverse groups. So the question remains: how can non-profit organizations (NPOs) establish themselves as development providers within the uncertain political arena, of which South Africa is characteristic, in order to represent all the masses who cannot speak for themselves and more than often find themselves in a marginalized and stigmatized position? Principle results Some Non-profit organizations recognize that their relationships with stakeholders is of great importance for their survival, various forms of communication take place without the necessary planning and without clear objectives for the development of these relationships. NPOs need a positive image and reputation due to financial implications where they do not have sufficient funds to support or market themselves effectively. In this climate of polarization NPOs play a pivotal role in providing a voice to the poor, mobilizing a motion of change and creating a platform for relationships, credibility and trust. Within the theoretical framework of relationship management theory, the interests of all stakeholders are balanced through the management of the stakeholder relationships. Major conclusions Non-profit organizations need to ensure that they protect their stakeholders (especially those who are in desperate need of the services rendered by these organizations), deliver better services and although not operating for the purpose of making a profit, manage themselves so that they do generate profit which will enable them to support themselves especially when funding is something that is becoming a rare phenomenon. Although NPOs find themselves in difficult financial times they need to renovate and almost reinvent themselves, in order to be fully capable to address many social problems in SA and to indicate to those who support them (especially financially) that they are to be trusted, committed to make a difference, that they deliver on their promises and to ensure open communication channels with all their stakeholders. NPOs need to manage their reputations which are built on their corporate identities because it is the organization's reputation that often creates a lifeline in uncertain times. If the NPOs succeed in managing their identities effectively, it may serve as the foundation for developing and maintaining relationships with their respective stakeholders which in turn could change the face of South Africa's society. These organizations might go about creating a platform for dialog in an attempt to build sustainable productive relationships that can go about uplifting and empowering those who would otherwise not have such an opportunity.",academic_review,"Non-profit organizations bridging the communication divide in a complex South AfricaSouth Africa's post-apartheid governments have made remarkable progress in consolidating the nation's peaceful transition to democracy, but many South Africans still view themselves and each other according to stigmatizing categories.

This study synthesised the current literature on this topic and included five case studies to understand the current state of internal communication within INGOs. It was determined that INGOs do not manage internal communication strategically. However, there is evidence that the implementation of strategic internal communication could help INGOs address several of their challenges and have an impact on their overall effectiveness. This study is exploratory and further research to identify the process for strategic internal communication in INGOs is needed."
2014,2,Tanya Le Roux,DR4 communication in the South African context: A conceptual paper,"Within the disaster risk reduction field the term that is used to encompass all pre- and post-disaster phases such as disaster planning, preparedness, prevention, mitigation, warning, impact, rescue, relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery (Van Niekerk, 2008, p. 367), is disaster risk reduction, response and recovery, shortly referred to as DR4. DR4 communication refers to communication, management applied during the disaster management phases. In the Hyogo Framework for Action (UN/ISDR, 2005), that calls for action to build resilience of nations against disasters, information sharing and cooperation, dialogue between parties involved in disaster management, public awareness and media relations is suggested as some of the priorities that should receive attention (UN/ISDR, 2005, p. 23). Authors, such as Wisner, Gaillard, and Kelman (2012, p. 1), also refer to the importance of communication between stakeholders and specifically the fact that disaster risk reduction requires specialist knowledge on communication management. In addition, the South African National Disaster Management Framework (SANDMF) specifically focuses on communication management and communication flow during incidences by identifying this aspect as one of the three enablers of the SANDMF (South Africa, 2005, p. 3). Communication responsibilities are even assigned to the Provincial Disaster Management Centre and Municipal, Disaster Management Centre (South Africa, 2005, pp. 13–14). Communication is thus regarded as a critical aspect of disaster management (Coombs, 2012, p. 17) and assistance with disaster communication management is needed in order to limit current problems experienced with communication in disaster risk reduction and disaster management (see International Wildland Fire Summit, 2003, Reid and Van Niekerk, 2008, p. 246). An analysis of disaster (crisis) communication literature showed that it mainly focuses on (i) pre- and post-crisis reputational communication from the profit organisation's point of view (Avery, Lariscy, Kim, & Hocke, 2010, p. 192) and (ii) on the profit organisation's expected technical reaction communication during the, crisis, i.e. who to phone to activate response agencies (Avery et al., 2010, p. 192; Littlefield et al., 2012, p. 248). From a disaster risk reduction field, the little information there is on communication, focuses on media engagement during a disaster (see Radford & Wisner, in Wisner et al., 2012, pp. 761–771; Van Niekerk, 2008, p. 362). Research on the trans-disciplinary focus of combining the disaster risk reduction and communication management fields, is lacking. This paper conceptualises DR4 communication by: Theoretically placing strategic communication management within the disaster risk reduction, and management paradigm, Defining DR4 communication; and Applying DR4 communication to the South African context. The findings indicate that appropriate disaster communication could assist to lessen the risk and aid disaster recovery (Hale, Dulek, & Hale, 2005, p. 112, 114) as communication practitioners could provide strategic information from the environment that could reduce uncertainty in strategic decision-making and ensuring that disaster management goals align with stakeholder expectations in order to save lives and limit the impact of a disaster (Grunig, 2006, p. 3, 6; Phillips, 2006a, Phillips, 2006b, p. 34, 35; Valin, 2004).

2014,2,Elsamari Botha,A means to an end: Using political satire to go viral,"With the rise of video sharing giants like Youtube and Google Video, coupled with increased broadband connectivity and improved sharing functionality across social networking sites, the role of the viral video has been cemented in many IMC strategies. While most agree about the importance of better understanding viral marketing, there is less agreement about what makes content become viral. While some content gets viewed by millions of people, others struggle to gain viral traction. Content specific, intrapersonal and interpersonal reasons have been proposed for viral marketing success. This paper focuses on the intrapersonal reasons for content going viral in the context of political satire. More specifically, the role of emotion in the spread of content online, is investigated. Political satire focuses on gaining entertainment from politics. Satire, and specifically political satire, forms part of using humour in advertising and has been influential in shifting public opinion since ancient Greece. This study compares success and unsuccessful viral campaigns that used political satire, by first analysing the online comments that viewers made about the video. Following these findings, an experiment is conducted and the influence of intensity, creativity, humour and utility on virality is modelled, controlling for valence and previous exposure. The findings suggest that, when using political satire in viral campaigns, creativity and the intensity of the emotions felt are key influencing factors in whether videos get “shared” or “liked”. Therefore, while many authors contend that particular emotions or positive content has a greater likelihood to become viral, this paper shows that it is not the particular emotion, but the intensity with which that emotion was felt that drives viral success.",academic_review,"A means to an end: Using political satire to go viralWith the rise of video sharing giants like Youtube and Google Video, coupled with increased broadband connectivity and improved sharing functionality across social networking sites, the role of the viral video has been cemented in many IMC strategies.

In order to understand the current state of affairs an exploratory qualitative approach was followed in which member associations were surveyed and their websites reviewed. The fact that fewer than half of the 27 member associations responded to the survey suggests that a study about this matter is not deemed particularly important and/or that the issue of professional status is not widely pursued. However, the associations that participated in this study agree that professional status is important. The study has also found that many similarities exist across continents in terms of the mechanisms utilized to achieve professional status. Codes of ethics, contributions to a body of the knowledge and the provision of professional training opportunities are regarded as quite important while divergent viewpoints exist in relation to issues like accreditation and a standardized tertiary curriculum.",academic_review,"Are we there yet?

Whether such practices have been effective in changing hearts and minds among international audiences, however, is open to debate and remains to be further explored. Within the perspective of sociology of knowledge, the main purpose of this study is to look at how China comes to be viewed as an object in international communication research over the past decades that cast the country through the prism of either propaganda or public diplomacy."

It also compared message strategies using a content analysis of Ministry of Foreign Affairs websites of eight countries that are recent members or candidates to join the European Union to examine how public diplomacy message strategies correlate with economic development, level of democracy, and perceptions of the country. The most common message strategy was informational. There were no statistically significant correlations between reputation and message strategy, but descriptive statistics show countries that used advocacy strategies had higher means for reputation. There was a significant correlation between the level of democracy and the use of advocacy messages. Findings indicate that transitional countries could benefit from advocacy and promotional message strategies.",academic_review,"Comparative public diplomacy: Message strategies of countries in transitionThis exploratory study used infrastructural variables that have been used in comparative public relations research and applied them to the study of public diplomacy.

2014,3,"Thomas Koch, Magdalena Obermaier",Blurred lines: German freelance journalists with secondary employment in public relations,"Nearly half of all German freelance journalists have a second job, mainly in public relations (PR). This work combination can be problematic, since journalists and PR practitioners have different responsibilities. Working as a journalist entails contributing to the public duties of journalism such as informing the public, offering multiple viewpoints, and representing societal interests; in contrast, PR practitioners must advocate solely in their clients’ interests. Conflicts can arise between these two roles if a freelance journalist is, for instance, required to critically investigate his or her PR client. However, there has been little research on freelance journalists with secondary work in PR. This study seeks to address this gap in research; therefore, we conducted a quantitative online survey among German “PR-journalists”. Our results show that nearly half of the participants take on secondary PR work for financial reasons; however, a similar number of journalists take on PR-work voluntarily, as they find the work interesting and enjoyable. Moreover, participants described their professional identity very similarly to that of German journalists in general. The PR-journalists surveyed were aware of the potential for conflicts of interest arising from their dual role. While such conflicts have been rarely encountered by those in the study sample, most participants assumed that other PR-journalists face such conflicts often, and expressed concern that these conflicts are not handled professionally.",academic_review,"Blurred lines: German freelance journalists with secondary employment in public relationsNearly half of all German freelance journalists have a second job, mainly in public relations (PR).

We selectively use professionalism as an underlying theoretical framework to explore key areas of PR as a profession in Vietnam by considering the impact of environmental variables such as culture and the media system. This paper provides a current snapshot of how an industry introduced by Western multinational corporations has adapted to the Vietnamese context. Demand for PR in Vietnam is still mostly driven by multinational corporations to promote products through media relations. Many Vietnamese companies are unsure about investing in PR due to a limited understanding of what it is, misperceiving the practice as advertorial placement due to a widely entrenched “envelope culture”. We have found interpersonal relationships during and outside of official work hours are highly valued for effective PR practice, and that clients mostly rely on agencies to implement execution rather than advise on long-term strategies. Our findings underscore the need for the establishment of a professional association and more PR training courses to increase understanding about the relatively new Vietnamese PR industry and guide its future development.",academic_review,"Vietnamese public relations practitioners: Perceptions of an emerging fieldOur exploratory research into contemporary PR practice in Vietnam is underpinned by 12 semi-structured interviews with senior Vietnamese PR executives from various agencies.

Through the use of vignettes, this experiment reveals that besides crisis-response strategy (diminish vs. rebuild), the communicated emotion (i.e., shame and regret) has a positive effect on corporate reputation. Mediation analyses showed that this effect of communicated emotion could be explained by the public's (negative) affective as well as cognitive responses (i.e., account acceptance). This study confirms that emotional signals embedded in crisis responses may affect corporate reputations by reducing feelings of anger and by increasing the acceptance of the organizational message.

2014,3,"Robert Wakefield, Tom Watson",A reappraisal of Delphi 2.0 for public relations research,"This paper introduces, analyzes, and explains the Delphi method of research, particularly as it applies to the public relations industry. The Delphi technique became known some 50 years ago when the RAND Corporation used it for forecasting. Since then, scholars and forecasters have used it periodically for qualitative explorations into complex issues or domains. The overall purpose of the Delphi is to facilitate formal discussion among selected experts in a given domain around a particular topic; it is particularly useful when those experts cannot easily gather in one place. The method encourages the sharing of diverging worldviews over a few “rounds” or iterations in the hope that the views may converge into some direction around the given topic. For this reason, the Delphi has often been used in situations or environments that tend to be somewhat ambiguous and where interviews and surveys are neither timely nor appropriate. Public relations scholars started incorporating the Delphi into their research in the late 1980s, and the technique has since been employed to explore broad-ranging issues among experts on at least a dozen occasions. However, aside from these particular studies, public relations literature contains little discussion about the technique and its possible applications or implications for developing knowledge in the field. This paper, then, is intended to dissect the pros and cons of the Delphi method so as to offer guidance to public relations scholars who may wish to use it in future studies. This paper is created through a literature review of similar articles on Delphi studies in other domains, followed by an examination of some studies conducted to advance issues in public relations. The authors explore the most appropriate situations for using a Delphi and list the benefits and disbenefits of different aspects or applications of the method. They trace the evolution of Delphi research from its early roots into the era of the Internet and social media, which offer new tools for increasing the number of respondents and moving through the Delphi process more quickly than could previously be done.

While university education was perceived by institute members to demonstrate the professional standing of public relations, the findings reveal divergent understandings of its role and content and identify considerable resistance to the institutionalisation of public relations knowledge. At the same time, the expansion and marketisation of higher education led to the introduction of new, vocational courses such as public relations.

These factors provide a springboard to consider some of the issues that currently challenge GA, some of which were inherent in the governance model it chose at its inception. Through the analysis of original documentation, supplemented by associated contemporary materials and in-depth interviews with key players, the paper seeks to address the following questions: why was GA created?

This essay explores the under-theorized relationship between ideology and public relations by examining the role of the corporate voice in public relations history. Evidence suggests that public relations counsel, serving as the corporate voice, created messages that produced and reproduced certain ideological meanings about the corporation. These ideological meanings provided important guidance on how members of the public should think about, relate to, and experience the corporation as a necessary, natural and benevolent organization in society. By incorporating ideological theory as an analytical tool to study public relations history, this article explores an important, but not often studied aspect of public relations history – the development and use of the corporate voice as a site of ideological production.",academic_review,"Corporate voice and ideology: An alternate approach to understanding public relations historyScholars in the U.S. generally agree that the origins of corporate public relations correspond to the rise of the U.S. Industrial Revolution during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Cluster two concerns the scale, methods, and ecological inclusiveness to engage with these changes; and, the third covers nation-centric mindsets, archival assumptions, and the impact of changing media. We also argue for PR historians resourcing the next stages of PR history from advances in historiography and history writing practices with particular attention to the point of view of the historian and awareness of the traditions and limitations, within which he, she, or they write.

2014,5,Burton St. John,The “creative confrontation” of Herbert Schmertz: Public relations sense making and the corporate persona,"Beginning in the early 1970s, Mobil Oil's public relations, under the direction of Herbert Schmertz, attempted to demonstrate to Americans that the company acted like a person who worked to benefit society. With an approach he called “creative confrontation,” Schmertz offered an adversarial stance toward the news media, coupled with inventive methods of supporting the arts. Creative confrontation sought the public's support by revealing that the corporation was an entity that understood the needs of the public and worked to uphold American values like free expression and progress. This work, in examining a distinctive and sustained effort to communicate the corporate personality, offers lingering implications for how public relations, through the conveyance of the corporate persona, can more widely conceptualize and execute its sense-making role in society.",academic_review,"The “creative confrontation” of Herbert Schmertz: Public relations sense making and the corporate personaBeginning in the early 1970s, Mobil Oil's public relations, under the direction of Herbert Schmertz, attempted to demonstrate to Americans that the company acted like a person who worked to benefit society.

This interview followed reports that Te’o had been involved in an elaborate hoax featuring a fake girlfriend. The interview was a worthy avenue of investigation as it was Te’o's first opportunity to publicly defend himself on camera following a week of ridicule and speculation by media outlets and the public. A deductive thematic analysis was conducted on Te’o's responses utilizing Benoit's image repair typology and other recently identified image repair strategies as a guide. Results revealed that Te’o did not deviate from previously established strategies by employing defeasibility, victimization, good intentions, stonewalling, retrospective regret, bolstering, shifting blame, and simple denial. Collectively, the employment of these tactics illustrated a timid, naïve, and remorseful approach to image repair.

We examine how the media frame Toyota's crises and responses, and whether the news coverage varied between mass media and Toyota's releases. The findings shed light on the crisis communication in terms of response strategy selection.

2015,1,"Jing Jiang, Yi-Hui Huang, Fang Wu, Hiu-Ying Choy, Di Lin",At the crossroads of inclusion and distance: Organizational crisis communication during celebrity-endorsement crises in China,"Celebrity endorsements, though popular as a means of communicating about products, carry high risks and may lead to negative consequences for the organizations that solicit them, especially when endorsers find themselves embroiled in scandals or crises unrelated to the products they promote. This study investigates how Liu Xiang's withdrawal from the 2012 London Olympics and Sun Yang's unlicensed driving crisis affected their sponsorships of Nike and Beijing Hyundai, respectively. Attribution theory and the concept of in-group/out-group orientation provide a framework for examining both primary and secondary public reactions to these public relations crises on Sina Weibo. As a comparative study, this paper adopts both qualitative (thematic analysis of two official announcements) and quantitative methods (content analysis of 738 Weibo postings). Within a Chinese cultural context, evidence indicates that celebrity-endorsement crises are internally attributed and perceived to be controllable. Where primary public attitudes are concerned, integrity violations lead to more negative reactions; however, inclusion strategies find a better reception than distancing, regardless of the public's crisis-responsibility attributions. For secondary online reactions, Weibo posters’ perceptions of external locus, controllability, and integrity violations generate more “likes” than organizational strategies, thereby proving themselves more influential online. This study ultimately provides a more comprehensive refinement of attribution theory by both conceptualizing crisis-response strategies with a discussion of Chinese cultural sensitivities and offering empirical data on the ways in which primary and secondary crisis communication affects stakeholders via social media.",academic_review,"At the crossroads of inclusion and distance: Organizational crisis communication during celebrity-endorsement crises in ChinaCelebrity endorsements, though popular as a means of communicating about products, carry high risks and may lead to negative consequences for the organizations that solicit them, especially when endorsers find themselves embroiled in scandals or crises unrelated to the products they promote.

The results indicate that organizations with a favorable pre-crisis reputation suffer less reputational loss from a crisis than organizations with an unfavorable pre-crisis reputation. The explanation for this effect is that consumers are reluctant to change their initial attitude toward an organization and therefore attribute less responsibility for a crisis to organizations with a favorable pre-crisis reputation.

These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders. Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view that communication is not so much communication between two or more actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of meanings in which one cannot foresee who is – or will be – involved, in what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part during the process. Scrum is such a method.

Theoretical part of the paper critically assesses the available human resource management (HRM) and internal communication literature, providing a thorough description of Xers’ and Digitals’ preferences toward eight HRM subareas (job design, recruitment and selection, performance management, compensations, nonmaterial motivation, training and development, career management and internal communication). Empirical findings, using data for 275 members of generation X and 544 members of Digitals, revealed substantially more similarities than differences between Xers’ and Digitals’ preferences toward various HRM practices.

An analysis of online practices and digital media perceptions of communication practitioners in Europe,"A key aspect for understanding and explaining online communication is the micro level of communication practitioners’ social media usage and their general attitudes towards digital platforms. This paper investigates how public relations practitioner's personal and professional use of social media is related to their perceptions of social media. A quantitative methodology was applied to perform this research. A population of 2710 professionals from 43 European countries working on different hierarchical levels both in communication departments and agencies across Europe were surveyed as part of a larger transnational online survey. Results show that practitioners with a high level of usage of social media give more importance to social media channels, influence of social media on internal and external stakeholders and relevance of key gatekeepers and stakeholders along with a better self-estimation of competences.

The challenge, then, is how to identify a broader range of potential recipients—or a larger public. Rather than the non-existent general public, the authors propose the term “latent diffused publics”—a term that combines the theoretical work of James Grunig and the linkages of Esman from the 1970s. The latent element of this type of public suggests that the public is out there ready to respond, but will not do so until triggered by a message. The diffused aspect refers to a public that is difficult or impossible to identify until it responds to the message. We believe that identifying a potential new type of public is more realistic as we move deeper and deeper into the era of social media communication.",academic_review,"Digital publics: Tracking and reaching themEven with social media we still have not reached a point where there is a general public in public relations.

The purpose of this theoretical article is to provide a framework to analyze the impacts of public diplomacy projects by acknowledging both its communication aspect and political nature. The pathways of connection framework is built in two-steps. First, the public diplomacy concept is situated in international politics by evaluating the concept through mainstream international relations theories. This evaluation yields three areas on which public diplomacy projects might have an impact. Second, the existing academic and practical measurement models are categorized under these areas and two pathways per area are presented. The theoretical framework can be used to understand different outcomes of public diplomacy projects and to provide a more accurate measurement of their success.",academic_review,"Pathways of connection: An analytical approach to the impacts of public diplomacyPublic diplomacy, albeit its functional similarities with public relations and other corporate communication tools, is inherently a foreign policy tool, used by practitioner states to advance their national interests and achieve their foreign policy goals.

2015,5,Anne Gregory,Practitioner-leaders’ representation of roles: The Melbourne Mandate,"This paper critically examines the Melbourne Mandate (Global Alliance, 2012), an advocacy platform developed by the Global Alliance (GA), the umbrella organisation representing 67 professional associations and 160,000 practitioners worldwide. The Mandate contains a proposition on how public relations professionals and professional bodies might better represent and promote their roles. The Mandate was created following a five-stage iterative process: first, a brainstorming session by GA Board members; second, a global survey of leaders of professional bodies identifying their opinions on issues requiring advocacy with key stakeholders such as business leaders, politicians, journalists and the public. Analysis of the 280 responses led to stage three, a three-strand ‘prospectus’ for discussion by the global public relations community. This led fourthly, to research and discussion by three global groups co-led by an academic and a practitioner drawn from the GA Board and from the pool of recognised leaders in the profession. These groups developed the three strands producing a draft Mandate which was then debated online before being discussed, in stage five, by 800 practitioners and academics attending the World Public Relations Forum in Melbourne, Australia in November 2012. Using face-to-face interactions, additional online observations, an on-site, online application and hard copy comments, the Mandate was refined and finalised in Melbourne. The Mandate identifies three critical roles for professionals: defining organisational character and values; building a culture of listening and engagement; and the fulfilment of responsibility in all its dimensions. The results offer an interesting representation of roles which can be seen as essentially normative, but which, examples demonstrated, are being enacted by some leading practitioners. The paper critically examines whether the Mandate furthers the GA's declared mission to advance the profession, and goes on to analyse both the process by which it was generated and the content. Among other topics the paper discusses whether the Melbourne Mandate could be proposed as a genuine attempt to capture the best representations of the practice and promote these for the benefit of the profession globally. Alternatively, it could be regarded as largely a distillation of the ambitions of the professions’ elite since the process was led by and largely shaped by them. It could also be argued as a further attempt at imposing western norms on a profession whose non-western members are under-represented in such initiatives (Gregory & Halff, 2013).

Journalists and communicators work in professional exchange and strive. The public relations practitioners are fully visible for the journalists; invisible are they only for the public. Silence has become a “code word” journalists use to pressure information sources not to shut up. This paper discusses public relations responses to that stigma, which include strategies of silence. I draw ideas from Aristotle's “apophatic” silence, Michel Foucault's “exhaustive representation”, Frances Sendbuehler's “profound communication silence” and John Cage's “sound of silence”. I suggest borrowing from those ideas and the development of silence and invisibility as central categories in public relations. Both are carriers of meaning. Both are ontological, neutral phenomena – neither good nor bad.

The paper includes an integrated literature review of contemporary text and theories on storytelling from academics and industry leaders relating to the benefits of using corporate stories; corporate stories and employee engagement; employee engagement and enhanced internal reputation; the link between internal and external reputation; the benefits of PR strategies to CSR; and the limitations of corporate storytelling. Results from a 2012 Australian corporate survey on the use of storytelling are also integrated into the review. Many theorists endorse corporate storytelling as a valuable medium for engaging with employees and improving internal reputation. However, both contemporary academic and industry analysis appears limited in acknowledgement of a link between internal storytelling and improved CSR.

2015,5,"Gregor Halff, Anne Gregory",What is public relations to society? Toward an economically informed understanding of public relations,"The notion of public relations contributing to the fabric of society is heavily contested in the public sphere and under-researched by the academy. The authors of this paper propose that the study of the relevance of public relations to society can be enlightened by turning to economics. Using information asymmetry as a framework, the argument is that public relations can be analyzed as a social institution that both helps to mitigate market imperfections and consequently increases the efficiency with which society’s resources are allocated as well as the chances for more market participants to derive value out of economic transactions.",academic_review,"What is public relations to society?

The chapter concludes with challenges for practitioners, individually and as a profession, to increase self-awareness, an essential prerequisite for ethical practice. It takes an interpretive approach, drawing on literature from Jungian scholarship, organisational psychology and moral philosophy. These explorations are developed at book-length in Fawkes (2014. Public relations ethics and professionalism: The shadow of excellence. London and New York, NY: Routledge), but here the focus is on practice and practitioners’ access to conscience through consciousness. After a brief summary of the Jungian psyche and the role of consciousness in activating conscience, this paper suggests questions and reflections for the profession and its constituent practitioners. This discussion is strongly linked to developing an ethical attitude (Solomon (2001).

This study asks about the role of transparency in the context of commercial hybrid content. Through theoretical consideration as well as interviews of representatives of public relations and marketing communication associations and agencies in Finland, the article presents the practitioners’ perceptions and experiences using the literature on transparency. To better understand the communicative organization of today in the context of hybrid content creation, we propose the concept of the “transparent communicative organization.” We suggest four new propositions for the practice of hybrid forms of engaging publics to support the transparent communicative organization: (1) source identification to enable trust, (2) two-way transparency inviting user feedback, (3) stakeholder-centric arenas to enable engagement, and (4) content on organizational expertise to build long-term engagement.

However, the fields of corporate communication and, more recently, business management have focused on different aspects of the notion. Despite such increased research interest, the concept of dialogue yields a range of analytical perspectives; this is due in part to the fragmentation of academic study, whereby scholars pursue parallel lines of inquiry that never intersect in interdisciplinary exchange. Therefore, the twofold purpose of this article is to explore the concept of dialogue in the context of business: on the one hand, to offer an interdisciplinary account of dialogue based on a model of analysis shaped by the five key dimensions of the concept; and on the other hand, to use the model to trace which perspectives are articulated in the related theory. In short, the article works towards a clearer understanding of the management implications that stem from the conceptualization of dialogue.",academic_review,"Reinventing the wheel?

These co-constructions of what it means to live in Singapore and what it means to be a citizen in that country were part of a research project to answer the call by critical political observers in Singapore to expand the space for ideas and perspectives regarding Singapore other than those from the governing elite. Led by a critical culture sensibility for theorising from below, the author spoke with 25 teenagers from troubled backgrounds, and analysed and interpreted the conversations using constructivist grounded theory. Fourteen categories emerged from the corpus, with negotiating becoming the core category articulating all 14 categories, and accounting for the dialectical relations amongst the categories as well as the discontinuities between the categories and the dominant nation building narrative as embodied in the Singapore Story. The core category instantiates the discursive empowerment of the youth. The suggestion is to open up discursive spaces for marginalised voices.

While recognizing the power of human agency in ethical decision-making, the article argues that in professional environments human agents also are bound by laws and contracts, which hamper unencumbered ethical decision-making in public relations practice. It critiques the role of public relations in promoting the ethical standards and ideologies of the powerful people they serve. They do this by presenting these ideologies and ethical standards as rational and objective. It argues for the rejection of universal codes of ethics of professional organizations in favor of individual, responsible ethical decision-making, which will be determined by the specific environment and situation of the practitioner.

This study develops understanding of the concept of city reputation through a multi-methods empirical study of two medium-sized Spanish cities where earlier research has shown there are gaps between government performance (as attested to by performance data on a series of city services), city communicators’ accounts of their communication strategies and policy priorities and citizens’ perceptions of their cities’ reputation and performance. Based on semi-structured interviews and focus groups, the reasons for these gaps are explored. The paradox of a less wealthy Malaga more content with the information it receives from its government and a more wealthy Vitoria critical of what citizens consider the government's self-congratulatory messages, suggests that more research should be carried out to understand both how government communication can achieve a better balance between information and persuasion and the importance of expectations and perceptions in citizens’ satisfaction with government communication and governments themselves.",academic_review,"Mind the gap: Local government communication strategies and Spanish citizens’ perceptions of their citiesCities have become the chief place of residence and work of the majority of the world's citizens and engines of regions’ prosperity.

In their examination of these campaigns the authors discern the following trends in best practices: social media campaigns employ digital storytelling techniques that are both immersive and emotive, and that promote various forms of content sharing; these stories involve members of the target audience in at least one form of open-ended offline engagement that involves sharing behaviors; the content is optimized for mobile displays and controls; and, finally, the content is timely. The authors conclude that, although marketers think of social media in terms of brand awareness and reputation management, the effective use of social media in Public Relations campaigns can generate conversion, facilitate brand positioning, and maintain continued brand sustenance. The authors conclude that the effective use of social media is disrupting the PR campaign cycle: the role of campaign events to generate publicity in service to a PR campaign may, in the future, be displaced by social media campaign tactics which belong to an entirely different ecosystem where the act of sharing social media content generates publicity in lieu of a campaign event.",academic_review,"Social media for public relations: Lessons from four effective casesThis paper employs the collective case studies approach in an examination of four award-winning public relations campaigns conducted across a variety of social media platforms in order to determine the best practices of, and near term trends, in the effective use of social media for public relations.

Today, corporations across the world enact CSR campaigns and use social media as one tool to tell their story of social responsibility. Yet, social media's strength as a relationship-building tool is not being realized as CSR activities are often communicated unidirectionally. This essay suggests alternative ways of thinking about social media in CSR. The essay offers a framework for using social media that goes beyond the one-way, monological, Homo Economicus based practices that characterize current social media use in CSR. The perspective proposed, Homo Dialogicus, focuses on interactive communication practices, that will help organizations move forward in building ethical organization–public relationships via social media.",academic_review,"From Homo Economicus to Homo dialogicus: Rethinking social media use in CSR communicationThis essay explores corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication through social media.

2016,1,"R.S. Zaharna, Nur Uysal",Going for the jugular in public diplomacy: How adversarial publics using social media are challenging state legitimacy,"Traditionally, nations have viewed other nations as their primary competitors in public diplomacy (PD). In a quest to increase their effectiveness, states are applying relationship management and pursuing a more relational PD approach with publics. However, present understanding of relationships may be one-sided, focusing primarily on the state's relationship-building activities and overlooking the public's agency in defining relations. This paper uses relationalism as an analytical lens to construct a 4-quadrant model of public diplomacy based on the relational dynamics between a state and publics. The model reveals a parallel evolution of communication technology and public diplomacy initiatives that move from assumptions of no relations with publics, to favorable relations, to adversarial relations. A case study from Turkey is used to illustrate how diverse groups can use social media to form unlikely alliances to become a fluid, adversarial public capable of ‘going for the jugular’ and challenging state legitimacy. Aggressive separation tactics by the state to counter adversarial publics can inadvertently create a ‘relational paradox’ that leaves the two parties more politically divided and yet more relationally intertwined. The study implications stress the need for states to monitor their relational dynamic with publics as a precursor for developing reflective strategies.",academic_review,"Going for the jugular in public diplomacy: How adversarial publics using social media are challenging state legitimacyTraditionally, nations have viewed other nations as their primary competitors in public diplomacy (PD).

It extends Gardner’s concept by adding a futures dimension to generate what I term “futures intelligence” that I argue is now necessary for the sustainability of the public relations field itself as well as of its clients. Futures intelligence is forward thinking, strategic, positive and empathetic. With its emphasis on future possibilities, futures intelligence not only provides practical ability to use the tools by which practitioners can plan and adapt for the long term but does this by taking into account societies’ collective needs rather than those of self-serving individuals.

2016,2,Paul Willis,From humble inquiry to humble intelligence: Confronting wicked problems and augmenting public relations,"This study seeks to upgrade the concept of humble inquiry into humble intelligence (HI) to address a particular set of seemingly intractable challenges known as wicked problems. It locates the concept of wicked problems in the academic literature to underpin its argument that, because of their ubiquity within organizations and across communities, wicked problems have implications for the practice of PR. It suggests that many of PR’s functional challenges within organizations can be characterised as “wicked,” while the discipline’s strategic interests suggest PR has a wider role to play in helping society address other “wicked” dilemmas. Despite these issues and opportunities the article identifies how PR has yet to recognize, let alone engage systematically with the challenges conceptualized as wicked problems. To confront them, the article sets out Schein’s notion of humble inquiry and upgrades it to humble intelligence, loosely defined as a cluster of multiple and interacting capabilities that, in concert, forge a form of collective intelligence amongst a wide range of stakeholders. In this coalition, HI can harness the dispersed knowledge that exists in communities and organizations to go beyond traditional, hierarchical, and, often, isolated forms of expertise. This reorientation engages wicked problems productively by deploying multiple perspectives, extending networks, and building the social capital required for collaboration. The article concludes that as well as gaining traction on seemingly intractable challenges, HI both complements and adds value to dialogic theories of PR.",academic_review,"From humble inquiry to humble intelligence: Confronting wicked problems and augmenting public relationsThis study seeks to upgrade the concept of humble inquiry into humble intelligence (HI) to address a particular set of seemingly intractable challenges known as wicked problems.

The current study provides a more nuanced examination of those functions and establishes an affective classification within the information function to help foster social change by LGBTI asylum-specific NGOs. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the conventional public relations measures of cognitive learning, affective responses and resulting behaviors are manifested within these online functions as well.

However, the reality is that Israeli public relations (PR) practitioners are engaged in promotion of paid digital content marketing (DCM) without full disclosure or transparency on various internet sites. Three major questions are therefore raised and discussed: (a) Does payment for content – which entails PR practitioners control over content – demand a review of PR practice definitions? (b) Does PR paid DCM makes “give-and-take relationships” with journalists and the “two-way symmetric model” redundant in digital channels? (c) What are the ethical implications of using paid DCM without full disclosure for PR practitioners and brand stakeholders? We suggest that definitions of PR should be reviewed in light of using undisclosed paid DCM. Moreover, we claim that the penetration of PR into buying digital media, and thus purchasing control in the same way as advertising, contributes to an ambiguous line between PR and advertising. From an ethical perspective, when paid DCM is embedded into our main digital information channels, often hiding commercial messages, readers may be confused between editorial and paid content generated by marketers. This confusion may well lead to a decline in the trustworthiness of media organizations and business organizations using this practice.",academic_review,"Public relations and the practice of paid content: Practical, theoretical propositions and ethical implicationsThis article focuses on the relatively new marketing phenomenon of embedded paid content.

Three major questions are therefore raised and discussed: (a) Does payment for content – which entails PR practitioners control over content – demand a review of PR practice definitions? (b) Does PR paid DCM makes “give-and-take relationships” with journalists and the “two-way symmetric model” redundant in digital channels? (c) What are the ethical implications of using paid DCM without full disclosure for PR practitioners and brand stakeholders? We suggest that definitions of PR should be reviewed in light of using undisclosed paid DCM. Moreover, we claim that the penetration of PR into buying digital media, and thus purchasing control in the same way as advertising, contributes to an ambiguous line between PR and advertising. From an ethical perspective, when paid DCM is embedded into our main digital information channels, often hiding commercial messages, readers may be confused between editorial and paid content generated by marketers. This confusion may well lead to a decline in the trustworthiness of media organizations and business organizations using this practice."

2016,4,"Magnus Fredriksson, Josef Pallas",Much ado about media: Public relations in public agencies in the wake of managerialism,"This paper rests on an assumption that media is much more than a communication channel or type of organization and that we have to take media under consideration if we want to understand the conditions for public agencies and their public relations activities. This is very much due to the processes of mediatization; that is to say, the double-sided process through which media (a) emerge as an autonomous institution with its own set of rationalities that other institutions adapt to; and (b) become an integrated part of other institutions’. A second assumption is that the extent to which public agencies adapt to media varies between different types of organizations, mostly as a consequence of an organization’s management structure. Public agencies governed by career managers are more eager to get media attention and control the media image of their organizations compared to agencies governed by field professionals. Circumstances that position public relations at the centre within agencies governed by career managers, but with limited freedom of action. This raises a number of questions concerning circumstances, motives and consequences for public relations and in this paper we suggest three propositions for how we can understand the interplay between media in its institutional form, public agencies and public relations (1) public relations professionals have limited control to what degree public agencies adapt to the media logic (2) public relations professionals have limited control over public agencies media activities due to their high level of formalization and standardization (3) public relations in public agencies is to an extensive degree limited to media activities.",academic_review,"Much ado about media: Public relations in public agencies in the wake of managerialismThis paper rests on an assumption that media is much more than a communication channel or type of organization and that we have to take media under consideration if we want to understand the conditions for public agencies and their public relations activities.

2016,4,Igor Savič,Mediatization of companies as a factor of their communication power and the new role of public relations,"The paper seeks to explore and analyze the mediatization of companies, and argues that companies are entering a new phase of mediatization that is no longer evident as an adaptation to the logic of mass media but now involves the incorporation of media logic into the company’s own media practices and communication structure. Companies are (i) transforming into producers of owned media and media content, and (ii) through their owned media, managing communication with stakeholders, which is (iii) significantly altering the role of corporate public relations. In the context of a case study of a company from the financial sector, the paper brings together three concepts – communication power, mediatization, and strategic communication – toward a new conceptual framework for assessing the characteristics of the communication dimension of modern companies. Such an analytical position enables the phenomenon of mediatization to be analyzed both in its historical dimension and structural dimension.",academic_review,"Mediatization of companies as a factor of their communication power and the new role of public relationsThe paper seeks to explore and analyze the mediatization of companies, and argues that companies are entering a new phase of mediatization that is no longer evident as an adaptation to the logic of mass media but now involves the incorporation of media logic into the company’s own media practices and communication structure.

As a consequence, our understanding of the complexity and fluidity of PR in wider socio-cultural contexts has been constrained. To combat this shortcoming, this paper invokes the notion of “field” from institutional theory to examine how the field of Chinese PR is socially constructed, negotiated and contested by a range of actors based on their shared or competing logics and contingent inter-relations. Data were mainly collected through 48 in-depth interviews with PR agency consultants, in-house PR practitioners, journalists and industrial regulators as well as through complementary documents. The results indicate that studying PR as a socially constructed field can refresh extant PR scholarship by providing a dynamic and relational account of PR practices, and by reflecting the multifaceted interaction among various institutional actors.",academic_review,"The emerging “field” of public relations in China: Multiple interplaying logics and evolving actors’ inter-relationsWhile public relations (PR) scholars have increasingly criticized the privilege of organizational interest, limited research has problematized the dominant analytical locus of organizational site.

But little of the available international research has embraced the worldviews and perspectives of practitioners operating in the rapidly developing countries of South East Asia, which include Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation, its sister state, Malaysia, the nearby international business hub, Singapore, the increasingly vigorous yet still tightly controlled one-party state of Vietnam, the business-friendly but politically fragile Thailand, and Asia’s only majority Christian nation, the Philippines. The broad social, political, economic and cultural diversity to be found among these major member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) arguably may have important implications for the ways in which public relations programs should be conducted in these locations. This paper reports on a doctoral research project conducted among public relations practitioners working across the ASEAN region, giving glimpses into how successful operators in these locations view their work, their working environments and the challenges they face in seeking to balance sensitive considerations of localism, regionalism and globalism in increasingly fluid cross-cultural environments. The concerns they report confirm some general observations around ‘cultural difference’ raised previously in other quarters, but also highlight more strongly some particular pre-occupations including sensitivities around political power, personal values conflicting with the values of clients, employers and target publics, the importance of understanding local linguistic issues, the distinctiveness of local media systems, and pressures arising from rapidly increasing pace of life in countries of the region.

The analysis shows that the rise of PR in the second half of the 19th century was, amongst others, a reaction to the development of journalism that had become increasingly biased. Thus, for many societal actors and organisations, the barriers to entering the public arena were increasing. At the same time the importance of the mass media, and pressures on social protagonists and organisations to legitimise their interests in a changing society, were growing.

Journalism and Public relations: The case of Bertha von Suttner, Austria","This article demonstrates the relationship between journalism and public relations in the case of Bertha von Suttner (1843–1914) from Austria, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate in 1905. Based on a literature review, the research in this article sheds light on both journalism and public relations in the late nineteenth century in view of this story of an extraordinary woman. Starting with the idea that Bertha von Suttner was not only a renowned journalist and writer, but also a propagandist for peace and women's rights, this paper notes that journalism and public relations are not just two sides of the same coin but, particularly in view of campaigns, can stand side by side for a cause. As well as a theoretical discussion, the contribution highlights the instruments utilised by Bertha von Suttner to fight for peace and equality. Furthermore, the results outline some perspectives, which logically illustrate that both journalism and public relations are based on the same intentions regarding campaigning. Due to this, journalism and public relations merge into one activism field.",academic_review,"One woman - Two sides of the Same Coin?

2016,5,João Moreira dos Santos,Roots of public relations in Portugal: Changing an old paradigm,"This article examines the roots of public relations (PR) in Portugal, which for the last three decades have been consensually placed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It argues that such a historical paradigm is contradicted by thorough archival research and needs to be revised. In fact the origins of PR activities can be traced back as far as the 1900s, having evolved initially under the terms of propaganda and press relations, with no apparent influence from the United States (U.S.). The specific term and the concept of PR arrived in Portugal only in the 1910s and matured from the 1930s to the late 1940s. They were first imported from the U.S., where in 1915 a Portuguese professor witnessed the PR activities carried out by the agricultural system. However, the modern concept, theory and practice of PR were mostly influenced by the United Kingdom (U.K.). The connecting link was The Anglo-Portuguese Telephone Co. Ltd. (APT), which pioneered the development of PR in Portugal. It directly benefited from the PR work that Basil Clarke did for a British pressure group whose chairman also managed APT. Regarding PR historiography this paper reinforces the thesis that PR developed in Europe independently from the U.S. tradition and long before World War II. It also places Portugal among the first European countries where PR emerged.",academic_review,"Roots of public relations in Portugal: Changing an old paradigmThis article examines the roots of public relations (PR) in Portugal, which for the last three decades have been consensually placed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

It is no wonder that the indelible marks of three and a half centuries of Spanish colonization followed by five decades of American occupation are still intensely palpable in every aspect of Philippine society. The aftermath of centuries of domination is no more pronounced than in the education of its citizens. This paper aims to trace the evolution of Philippine public relations education, examine its influences and critically evaluate the content and status of the public relations curriculum using a post-colonial lens. Public relations is one of the Philippine imports from the United States after the Second World War. This study interrogates how this Western transplant is addressing the dueling interests of multiple stakeholders and the competing priorities of a developing country steeped in the traditions of a colonial past. Through a primary analysis of 20 Philippine undergraduate and graduate programs, personal interviews and secondary research, the historical analysis revealed private, mostly Catholic, universities as key providers of PR education. The study also found that Philippine PR education is still nascent, elitist, and requires a research culture to help professionalize practice.",academic_review,"We are what we teach: The impact of persuasive communication on Philippine PR history and contemporary PR educationThe history of the Philippines is one of colonial struggle.

As Twitter has emerged as a major digital PR tool for politics over the last decade, it provides a text to examine political candidates’ PR strategies. Focusing on the cases of the two then-front runners for the 2016 U.S. presidential election – Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the present study examines differences in the ways in which they self-present and communicate with voters through their websites and Twitter. Content analysis of their websites and sampled tweets (N = T295, C228) reveals significant differences in their emphasis on traits and issues, main content of tweet, main source of retweet, multimedia use, and the level of civility. While Clinton emphasizes her masculine traits and feminine issues more than her feminine traits and masculine issues, Trump gives more weight to masculine issues, paying no particular attention to his traits. The differences were found consistently on their websites and on Twitter. Trump utilizes user-generated content as sources of his tweets significantly more often; while three quarters of Clinton’s tweets are original content, half of Trump’s tweets are retweets of and replies to citizens. The most popular content is opinion about public issues for Clinton, and others’ endorsements or supportive quotes for Trump. One out of ten (10.5%) Trump tweets include uncivil wording.

First, an expert review determined the fit between the CSR initiatives presented in the news articles and the core business of the organizations pursuing these initiatives. Second, a quantitative content analysis measured tone and framing of the news articles. The results reveal that while CSR fit does not influence tone, it does partly impact the framing of the media coverage, as CSR fit leads to a positive framing of organizations and their CSR activities. However, vice versa, CSR misfit does not necessarily lead to a negative representation of organizations and their CSR in the media coverage.

2017,1,"Anne Gregory, Gregor Halff",Understanding public relations in the ‘sharing economy’,"In spite of the macro-economic impact of the so-called ‘sharing economy’ there is a nearly complete dearth of contributions from the communication academy to its discourse. More attention is overdue, particularly for the conceptual pressure the ‘sharing economy’ is exerting on the public relations function. The authors propose a reconceptualization of public relations by identifying the constitutive aspects of the sharing economy and bringing together the explanatory concepts ‘circuits of commerce’ and ‘viable matches’ from economic sociology and communicative constitution of organizations theory to develop the notions of ‘deliberate disintermediation’ and ‘circuits of communication’ in public relations. The contention is that by doing this, communicative acts not only contribute meaning in the sharing economy, but have economic value. Furthermore, the sharing economy poses challenges to the traditional forms of organizing public relations functions, but offers opportunities to realize different potential when public relations facilitates circuits of communication and becomes a meta-communicative competence embedded within the organization.",academic_review,"Understanding public relations in the ‘sharing economy’In spite of the macro-economic impact of the so-called ‘sharing economy’ there is a nearly complete dearth of contributions from the communication academy to its discourse.

2017,1,"Bridget Tombleson, Katharina Wolf",Rethinking the circuit of culture: How participatory culture has transformed cross-cultural communication,"This paper explores the influence of digital communication − and in particular social media − on cross-cultural communication, based on the Circuit of Culture model. Scholarly literature supports the notion that social media has changed the speed at which we communicate, as well as removed traditional (geographical) boundaries around cross-cultural campaigns. Since the introduction of digital media, the role of the public relations practitioner has become more strategic in order to maintain relevance with even more diverse − and dispersed − audiences. Large scale campaigns, like the Human Rights Campaign to support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) rights, have seen messages spread far beyond the country of origin, and with that, demonstrate the ability to affect advocacy campaigns in other countries. The authors argue that instead of acting as cultural intermediaries, public relations practitioners must become cultural curators, with the skills to create meaning from audiences, who are now content creators in their own rights, and encourage a true participatory environment that sees cultural values shared as part of an organic exchange process.",academic_review,"Rethinking the circuit of culture: How participatory culture has transformed cross-cultural communicationThis paper explores the influence of digital communication − and in particular social media − on cross-cultural communication, based on the Circuit of Culture model.

This study examines the CSR activities of several Multinational Corporations in Indonesia, in particular how they adjust/adapt to the local wisdom in their efforts to attain their CSR goals. The main theory applied in our study is the Symbolic Convergence Theory, supported by the Accommodation Communication Theory. Three Multinational Corporations in Indonesia were chosen as subjects of this research. Analysis is based on the Collaborative Social Responsibility Model (Kartikawangi, 2015) and Cross Cultural Communication Competence in Business Interaction models (Kartikawangi et al., 2016). At present “positive” actions are increasing by companies in efforts to better understand the society they are working in. Clearer understandings of local, regional and national societal factors are required to enhance the corporation’s product development programs, marketing strategies, and CSR strategies. Local, regional and national societal groups are in positions to choose what should be provided by the companies in achieving shared and practical Symbolic Convergence meanings. The societal groups actively present their aspirations, but also the aspirations and local wisdom that must be absorbed by the company.

It draws on a recent major global study that was sponsored by the former Research Foundation of the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC). Analyzing the results from interviews with 26 Chief Communication Officers (CCOs) located in each of the five continents and from a survey sample of some 278 CCOs based in organizations headquartered across the globe, the study found quite notable variations in the type of departmental structures. No one dominant structural model emerged. In effect, each organization appeared to adopt a structural design to suit their individual circumstances, although there were nevertheless some reasonably common component functional elements within each department. CCOs identified those variables that they believed most influenced the design of the public relations department structure. While recognizing department structure is situation dependent, the evidence suggests that CCOs create hybrid structures unique to the circumstances. What was perhaps most surprising was that department structure did not appear to be strongly influenced by department size, other than in terms of the vertical structural design. In short, there do not appear to be any common formulas or prescribed solutions for how organizations should or do orchestrate the design of the public relations department structure, rather CCOs appear to be able to exercise a degree of latitude in determining what works best for them.",academic_review,"Structure of the public relations/communication department: Key findings from a global studyThis paper reports on some of the core findings from a program of research focused on examining the structure of public relations/communication departments.

As Europe imposes new data protection laws and incorporates the right to be forgotten that promotes censorship through search engine de-linking, United States constitutional law scholars ponder the implications of World Wide Web censorship, while journalists and public relations professionals struggle to understand how accurate transparent communication could occur in an ecosystem that allows for arbitrary information removal and the creation of memory holes. This article explains why the European notion of the right to be forgotten challenges U.S. constitutional law and professional public relations ethics, imperiling the online marketplace of ideas and eroding disclosure of information. The European Data Protection Directive and recent right to be forgotten movements directly conflict with the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment and professional communications ethics codes. The First Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights indicates the specific rights of citizens to freedom from government intervention into freedom of expression and freedom of the press.

Understanding the role of values in driving attitudes and behaviors is crucial for four reasons: The new polarized, politicized, and value-driven public information environment requires corporate communicators and other public relations professionals to understand how people’s identity and values hardwire their decisions and actions. In this environment, information alone is not enough to change opinion. Facts and figures are often dismissed or are rejected when they go against people’s sense of identity or existing values, making connecting to deep-seated motivations crucial. Communicators needs to explore what is in the background of people’s opinions—not just the foreground. They must go beyond an over-reliance on rational responses to direct questions and an obsession with dry metrics. Mapping out rational opinions against nonconscious values unearths more textured insights and communication strategies.

A psychological and sociological approach to the challenge of conflicting expectations,"The paper enquires into the role of self-deception in public relations struggling with discrepancies between heterogeneous stakeholder expectations and organizational interests and particularly between normative expectations of truthfulness and practical temptations of deception. Drawing on theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology and sociology, we propose a framework for the origins, drivers, and functions of self-deception in public relations. The analysis reveals that under specific conditions self-deception can be an essential mechanism in public relations because it relieves practitioners from tensions driven by conflicting perceptions of truth and legitimacy. Self-deception is most likely to occur in situations of cognitive dissonance for practitioners to balance internal information processing and in situations of normative pressure when practitioners seek to comply with external expectations.",academic_review,"Self-deception in public relations.

The analysis reveals that under specific conditions self-deception can be an essential mechanism in public relations because it relieves practitioners from tensions driven by conflicting perceptions of truth and legitimacy. Self-deception is most likely to occur in situations of cognitive dissonance for practitioners to balance internal information processing and in situations of normative pressure when practitioners seek to comply with external expectations."

In this context, a national survey was conducted among 805 respondents, with three purposes. First, this case study aimed to explore how Belgians deal with the threat by examining if they change their behavior in public places and seek information about the threat. Second, we investigated why people seek and process information about the terrorism threat based on three determinants, namely their level of involvement with the threat, the expert efficacy of the government, and attitudes towards mass media communication. Finally, this study elaborated on perceived governmental efficacy, researching how governmental reputation is affected through institutional trust and governmental responsibility. The results show that the terrorism threat leads citizens to be more alert in public places and participate less in mass events. Moreover, one fifth stopped traveling by public transport. It was found that Belgian citizens also searched for information several times a day, mostly via traditional media such as television and radio. Furthermore, based on structural equation modelling, we found that information seeking and processing behavior is determined by the cognitive assessment of the risk. This cognitive risk assessment is in turn positively influenced by risk involvement and perceived governmental expert efficacy. However, if the mass media are seen to focus too much on drama and sensationalism then the perception of risk decreases, and this in turn reduces information seeking behavior. In addition, results show that a perception of governmental expert efficacy is able to increase trust and decrease the level of governmental responsibility, which is in turn beneficial for governmental reputation.

At the beginning of the War, Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel received instructions from the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to return to Paris and assist the Spanish embassy in various types of counterintelligence and propaganda work. As part of this, Buñuel organized and assembled footage of the Republicans. Unlike other productions compiled in Spain, the Republican propaganda films made in Paris were generally addressed at audiences in different European countries with the aim of breaking the doctrine of non-intervention in the conflict, and they reflect Buñuel’s theories and conception of the documentary films. These films represent good examples of ethical propaganda and their aim was more informative than manipulative. From this standpoint, and in accordance with other research on public relations discourse and film, we argue that the films supervised by Buñuel in this period, and especially the most noteworthy documentary España leal en armas (1937), are examples of public relations films in wartime.",academic_review,"Public relations discourse, ethical propaganda and collective identity in Luis Buñuel’s Spanish Civil War filmsThe Spanish Civil War occupies a very relevant place in the collective memory of Europeans.

Despite the pharma industry's ever-increasing share in framing media coverage of health issues, the strategies used in its press materials have not yet been systematically examined. This study uses framing theory to explore the PR strategies and tactics employed by pharmaceutical companies to promote their products in Israel, where DTCA is banned. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative content analysis, we examined 1548 pharmaceutical press releases. The Israeli example can serve as a case study for understanding how the pharma industry operates in many countries around the world where DTCA is banned. Our findings show that strategies and tactics dubbed as “disease mongering” dominate the pharma industry’s press releases. The four main strategies identified in this study are third party technique, disease branding, drug branding and Astroturfing. Some of the common PR strategies and tactics we found are not only unethical, but also opposed to the regulatory bodies in Israel, and would never receive approval, even in countries where DTCA is allowed.",academic_review,"“Under the regulation radar”: PR strategies of pharmaceutical companies in countries where direct advertising of prescription drugs is banned—The Israeli caseIn most Western countries, where direct advertising of prescription drugs (DTCA) is banned, the pharma industry relies primarily on PR activities to promote its products.

Second, we included 16 in-depth interviews with leading magazine health journalists and their editors-in-chief to confront the findings of the content analyses and search for additional evidence of how the pharmaceutical industry directly and indirectly tries to influence health news. The findings confirm that academic and medical experts are the most important sources. They help to explain and contextualize often complex and technical health issues, and they credit authority and credibility to a journalist’s story. In contrast, we found very little explicit references to pharmaceutical industry sources in journalistic content.

Our analysis found that corrective action is the most successful and third most common strategy, particularly when paired with another strategy, such as reducing the offensiveness or bolstering. Denial, in contrast, is the least successful strategy, particularly when paired with evasion of responsibility, or reducing the offensiveness. Yet denial was the most frequently used strategy. Our analysis also uncovered mitigating factors that help shape success or failure, including one’s guilt or innocence, remaining silent, potential legal action, the scope of the crisis, and promptness in responding.

We analyzed 110 articles across 51 peer-reviewed journals from 1986 to 2016 to determine any themes or patterns in the strategies used by organizations and/or individuals facing crises or threatened reputations. Our analysis found that corrective action is the most successful and third most common strategy, particularly when paired with another strategy, such as reducing the offensiveness or bolstering. Denial, in contrast, is the least successful strategy, particularly when paired with evasion of responsibility, or reducing the offensiveness. Yet denial was the most frequently used strategy. Our analysis also uncovered mitigating factors that help shape success or failure, including one’s guilt or innocence, remaining silent, potential legal action, the scope of the crisis, and promptness in responding. Theoretical implications include a broader understanding of strategies people choose as well as intersecting contexts and factors that determine success or failure. Practical implications center on helping practitioners better utilize image repair strategies."

In a study conducted in 2016, we examined some elements of the relationship between public relations practitioners and journalists in Croatia. In this study we extend our previous research into another country – Serbia, and compare the results. Comparing the attitudes of Croatian and Serbian practitioners is essential for the expansion of public relations in those two countries, as well as for the development of global principles. The main goal of this study was to explore the relationship between the Serbian journalists and public relations practitioners. We used the coorientational model to analyze the perceptions and cross-perceptions of journalists and public relations practitioners on their role in organizational reputation building. Our results showed that the difference between the Croatian and Serbian practitioners is not in the general direction, but in the intensity of the connection. This means that the trends which exist among the Croatian public relations practitioners and journalists also exist among their Serbian colleagues, but that the level of understanding is different. In this study, both the journalists and public relations practitioners believe they have a significant influence on the organizational reputation. Both groups showed a certain level of pluralistic ignorance of the other side. The results of this study have pinpointed some interesting similarities as well as significant differences between the two groups of practitioners. Even though the trends in Croatia and Serbia are similar and show an increasing understanding between public relations practitioners and journalists, Serbia has quite an unhappy group of journalists and a very confident group of public relations practitioners. We have confirmed the findings suggesting that the situation has improved and that the animosity has been on the decline, but Serbia still has a long way to go. Just as we concluded in our previous study the only way forward in further improving this relationship is by educating the journalists about the specifics of the public relations practice and by raising the level of how each of the fields perceives the value of their own efforts.",academic_review,"Journalists and public relations practitioners: Comparing two countriesThe existence and nature of conflict between the journalists and public relations practitioners has sparked a lot of interest in both academic fields.

A survey was conducted to analyze the perceptions of coverage and mass media orientations of Dutch communication professionals working for those organizations. For public organizations, actual media favorability and perceived visibility turned out to be important predictors of the media orientation ‘attention seeking’. The organizations were rather homogeneous in their relations between actual and perceived media coverage and the media orientation ‘strategic impact’.

Indeed, considering recognition and reputation to be critical elements for human beings in a conflictual society in which gaining power was the main goal, Hobbes anticipated critical public relations thinking. In the Hobbesian system, because recognition is a social capital, reputation management becomes the most appropriate relational strategy to negotiate and gain power. Accordingly, uncertainty characterizes reputation and dealing with it fits into risk management. Although Hobbes never used the concepts of public relations or reputational risk, he was the first thinker to approach social relations from a conflictual perspective and view reputation as a risk deriving from it. Thus, through his approach, Hobbes opened up a new perspective, differing from those of other renowned Renaissance thinkers like Machiavelli or even some of his contemporaries, like Gracián, who also dealt with the idea of reputation.",academic_review,"Recognition, symbolic capital and reputation in the seventeenth century: Thomas Hobbes and the origins of critical public relations historiographyThe intellectual history of public relations has not paid attention to British political philosopher Thomas Hobbes.

The results demonstrate that, when evidence against the company is weak, trust is restored more successfully with a denial than an apology. Contrary to our hypothesis, denial was found to outperform apology in repairing perceptions of the company’s integrity and benevolence even in the face of strong evidence, and it was as effective as apology in restoring perceived ability and trusting intentions.

Through a content analysis of 160 audiovisual crisis responses, this study examines which nonverbal cues of deception are communicated by organizations and individuals in crisis and how situational factors (e.g., crisis type) affect the occurrence of these nonverbal cues. The findings show that several nonverbal cues of deception occur in audiovisual crisis communication and that their occurrence depends on the crisis type, the source, and the crisis communication format."
2017,4,"Weiting Tao, Sora Kim",Application of two under-researched typologies in crisis communication: Ethics of justice vs. care and public relations vs. legal strategies,"This study investigates organizations’ crisis responses by adopting two extant, under-researched typologies—public relations vs. legal strategies and ethics of justice vs. care approaches. Through content-analyzing organizational responses to three well-known crises, the study observes that the public relations strategy is used more often than the legal strategy. It also finds that when the examined organizations respond to their crises, they tend not to emphasize ethical approaches, though when they do it is more often the ethics of justice approach than that of the ethics of care. Therefore, this study urges organizations to reflect on whether their crisis communication and management decisions lack sufficient emphasis on ethical approaches, especially on the interpersonal and situational aspects of involved publics in crises. If such deficiency exits, it would be problematic because these interpersonal and situational aspects, when addressed strategically, can help an organization to rebuild post-crisis reputation and maintain positive relationships with its publics in the long run.",academic_review,"Application of two under-researched typologies in crisis communication: Ethics of justice vs. care and public relations vs. legal strategiesThis study investigates organizations’ crisis responses by adopting two extant, under-researched typologies—public relations vs. legal strategies and ethics of justice vs. care approaches.

This paper takes critical stock of public relations scholarship and practices in the daunting complex that has become known as the infrastructural approach to risk communication. This approach blends critical judgment of the community structures where risk is discussed and the discourse in which it is analyzed as the foundation for risk governance needed for fully functioning societies. The critical lens of hegemony and postmodernism reveals how an increasing amount of risk communication scholarship and practice has evolved into a new professional, industrial, and societal hegemony that often marginalizes risk bearers and risk arbiters as a nuisance in an otherwise modern and elitist approach to risk control through which risk communication becomes a “priced commodity.” Such commodification can empower organizations to take further risks because of the perceived confidence that its robust risk management programs and risk communication teams, including public relations, can control the dialogue and thereby help protect it from business continuity failure. The great challenge is whether risk communication and management ultimately favors the interests of elites over, and even to the marginalization and subjugation of, the interests of risk bearers and arbiters, ignoring the experiences of inequalities over the life span.",academic_review,"Marketplace commodification of risk communication: Consequences for risk bearers and implications for public relationsSociety’s attempt to understand and communicate about risk is perhaps the world’s oldest topic − the rationale for human existence and survival (Douglas, 1992).

Kuwaiti organizations were found to use Twitter and Instagram the most for promotion and information dissemination, but the use is generally occasional and reactive. Extending the organizations’ reach and popularity of social media among Kuwaitis were the main advantages for using this type of media, while lack of social media strategy, lack of technical skills, and confusion of the two-way communication approach were the main barriers. A new finding can be added to the literature where insufficient educational background was found to contribute to the practitioners’ reluctance to adopt and adapt to using social media. As to any causing change to PR, the respondents believe that social media have broadened the field and have made organizations look less official and more mainstream in the popular culture.

Taking an employee-centric approach, the paper investigates employee satisfaction with opportunities to exercise their voice, and assesses employee views on the quality of senior management receptiveness to employee voice. The paper aims to address gaps in the literature by exploring potential associations between employee voice and organisational engagement. A questionnaire was used to gather data from 2066 participants in five UK-based organisations. The questionnaire used in the study was designed to explore satisfaction with upward employee voice and senior management receptiveness. It also enables exploration of the relationship between upward employee voice, senior manager receptiveness and emotional organisational engagement. A significant and positive relationship was found between upward employee voice and emotional organisational engagement; and between senior manager receptiveness and emotional organisational engagement. Regression analysis suggests that the majority of the employee voice variables included in the study predict emotional organisational engagement. While the study involved data collected from a reasonably large number of participants, it was limited to five UK-based organisations. The paper includes reflection on practical implications of the findings for internal communication management. In particular, it considers implications for senior management communication with employees including building employee voice into internal corporate communication strategies and plans. Suggestions for further research are included. The paper contributes to employee engagement literature by expanding insight on organisational engagement. Since relatively little previous research has considered the interplay between internal communication, organisational engagement and employee voice, the study makes a useful contribution to an under-researched area.",academic_review,"Employee voice: An antecedent to organisational engagement?Employee engagement is recognised as important for organisational effectiveness and a factor in achieving innovation and competiveness.

2017,5,Ganga S. Dhanesh,"Putting engagement in its PRoper place: State of the field, definition and model of engagement in public relations","Although engagement has been a catchword in public relations practice and theory for over a decade, the term has been applied rather loosely to imply any form of communicative interaction between publics and organizations. Despite lack of clarity on the concept of engagement, research has been thriving, propelled by the increasing prevalence of social media and organizations’ consequent rush to digitally engage publics. This paper assesses the use of engagement in the field of public relations and critiques the equation of engagement with communicative interaction, with its foregrounding engagement as collaboration over that of engagement as control. It also builds upon theoretical conceptualizations of public/stakeholder engagement, employee engagement, and digital engagement to propose a practice-relevant and theoretically informed model and definition of engagement: Engagement is an affective, cognitive, and behavioral state wherein publics and organizations who share mutual interests in salient topics interact along continua that range from passive to active and from control to collaboration, and is aimed at goal attainment, adjustment, and adaptation for both publics and organizations.",academic_review,"Putting engagement in its PRoper place: State of the field, definition and model of engagement in public relationsAlthough engagement has been a catchword in public relations practice and theory for over a decade, the term has been applied rather loosely to imply any form of communicative interaction between publics and organizations.

The results indicate that scarce studies on public engagement tend to be mostly concerned with social media and online engagement, studied from management/functional and relational perspectives, focussed on organizations, anchored in western traditions and dominated by quantitative methodology. This indicates that public engagement tends to be conceptualized as a phenomenon that organizations need to “manage” to advance their interests rather than to understand in terms of dynamics, connectedness, participation, dialogue, and interactions with publics. It is strongly influenced by post-positivism with some encouraging evidence of paradigmatic turn towards socio-cultural and critical approaches.",academic_review,"Engagement in public relations discipline: Themes, theoretical perspectives and methodological approachesSeveral practitioners and experts in the field of public relations have emphasized the importance of public engagement in the context of new technological and social developments and the impact this has on reshaping and reconceptualising public relations.

Over the past few decades, the boundaries between the three sectors have blurred, and new types of organizations and initiatives that combine environmental aims with business approaches have emerged. These new organizations and initiatives create a challenge for public relations practitioners: practitioners need to raise awareness among various publics to a new type of organization that combines both societal and business-like characteristics, and they need to promote dialogue and engagement with these publics. This study focuses on social businesses—that is, self-sustainable businesses that address social goals (Yunus, 2007). Based on a representative sample of 202 respondents, this study utilizes the Diffusion of Innovations theory (DOI) (Rogers, 1962) to argue for the importance of engagement to a successful process of diffusion and to demonstrate how DOI theory might enrich public relations theory and practice.",academic_review,"Public relations and social businesses: The importance of enhancing engagementPublic relations is usually practiced within three clearly defined organizational settings: the public or governmental sector, the private or business sector and the social nonprofit sector.

While not offering solutions, this paper suggests that several areas warrant review, including the place of visual communication; engaging with the implications of increasing use of mobile devices and with the fast-developing field of The Internet of Things. The paper also applies information foraging theory to public relations practice, suggesting it offers a pointer to how practitioners might approach their communication tasks.",academic_review,"Blink and they’re gone: PR and the battle for attentionAre you paying attention?

Thousands of innocent people were injured or killed. In its sharp lines, its confusion and its distorted shapes, Guernica shows the suffering and pain of war. Rather than using color, especially vivid reds, Picasso used only black and white paint as symbols of death, mourning and tragedy. He believed that brighter colors might distract the viewer from the agony of the scene. In Guernica, most of the figures have open mouths; hear them shouting, groaning or screaming. The aim of this paper and its relevance to public relations is to examine whether and how visual communication can publicize and frame a military event, the character of military leaders, and warfare as a generic aspect of democratic self-governance. This paper proposes that rhetorical, discursive art can contribute impact to public relations efforts, by focusing attention, making issues public, and making informative, framing, and democratizing statements. Even more important is the ability of art to express moral outrage, especially when giving voice to muted interests.",academic_review,"Publicizing atrocity and legitimizing outrage: Picasso’s GuernicaPicasso created his most famous painting, Guernica, in just over three weeks in 1937 after the bombing of the little town of Guernica, located in the Basque region, during the Spanish Civil War.

By detecting or perceiving a crisis before other stakeholders do, an organisation can prevent or mitigate a crisis. Few studies have considered the question of whether organisations put the right people in the right places to be able to see a crisis coming. Within an organisation, managers are usually well placed to take decisions to initiate crisis communication, but they seem to be reluctant to do so or may not wish to see an impending crisis. Communication professionals should have a better perception of a crisis, but they rarely find themselves in a position to have a substantial impact on the management decision to communicate during a crisis. In this paper, we study crisis perception by individuals in a large governmental organisation during various stages of an unfolding crisis and compared perception scores to individual profiles based on study background, professional situation and crisis experience. This study involves a large-scale scenario-driven survey with ‘crisis perception’ as the main dependent variable. The results of this specific case indicate that an academic communication degree, a high hierarchical position in the organisation and crisis experience are positively related to an augmented perception of an impending organisational crisis.",academic_review,"Factors that influence organisational crisis perception from an internal stakeholder’s point of viewThis paper starts from the premise that crisis is a perception and that one of the best ways to conquer a crisis is not to allow it to develop in the first place.

Emerging evidence indicates that the emotional experiences of publics play a critical role during organizational crises and determine the degree to which organizations are able to successfully devise communications that help them deal with such crises. Yet no comprehensive, theoretically sound model exists for analyzing how emotions influence the cognitive processing of crisis information.

Our model describes how emotional variables determine whether the publics take a cognition-oriented approach or an emotion-oriented approach to information processing and subsequent formation of interpretations, evaluations, and judgments directed toward organizations. Moreover, our model explains how an emotion-to-cognition assessment of publics’ attitudes is possible and makes a case for how it is critical for predicting and influencing the publics’ behavior during organizational crises. The hope is that this model will aid practitioners and academics in understanding why the publics’ emotions matter during crisis communication as well as how to craft more effective communication strategies as a result.

It traces Buber’s writings and activities as communicator in the service of the early Zionist movement and, in his later life, as campaigner against the establishment of the State of Israel, and as promoter of dialogue between Zionists and Arab Palestinians. Based on archival research the article uncovers Buber’s political and PR work to provide insights into his philosophy in the context of his political and life experiences. Inspired by Buber’s work the article argues that dialogue and strategic communication both have the potential to be deployed ethically, and for prosocial causes, or to be deployed in a self-serving and unethical way.

2018,1,Pip Mules,Reflections on the absence of formal reflection in public relations education and practice,"This content analysis is a part of wider research into the value of reflective practice in public relations education and practice. Examination of this topic is important given that reflective practice is widely recognised as an essential element for claims of professionalism (Dewey, 1933; Schön, 1983, 1987), and professionalism remains an elusive goal for PR practitioners (L’Etang, 2009). This article examines the extent to which the terms and processes associated with reflective practice are formally included in the contents of a range of widely used and well regarded public relations textbooks. The aim is to provide insight into the significance (or lack of it) of reflective practice in contemporary public relations curricula. Given that textbooks are highly influential teaching media that both reflect and shape curricula, conclusions about the emphasis of reflective practice in public relations teaching can be drawn as a result of this analysis. The findings indicate that – based on the content of the textbooks analysed – reflective practice is not formally included in the public relations teaching curriculum. Further research is needed to determine whether this omission also reflects the situation in public relations practice.

Examination of this topic is important given that reflective practice is widely recognised as an essential element for claims of professionalism (Dewey, 1933; Schön, 1983, 1987), and professionalism remains an elusive goal for PR practitioners (L’Etang, 2009). This article examines the extent to which the terms and processes associated with reflective practice are formally included in the contents of a range of widely used and well regarded public relations textbooks. The aim is to provide insight into the significance (or lack of it) of reflective practice in contemporary public relations curricula. Given that textbooks are highly influential teaching media that both reflect and shape curricula, conclusions about the emphasis of reflective practice in public relations teaching can be drawn as a result of this analysis. The findings indicate that – based on the content of the textbooks analysed – reflective practice is not formally included in the public relations teaching curriculum. Further research is needed to determine whether this omission also reflects the situation in public relations practice. This research has relevance for public relations educators given that they play a significant role in influencing future generations of public relations professionals. It concludes with a call for a shift in public relations education that includes greater emphasis on reflective practice."
2018,1,"Katerina Tsetsura, Kelsie Aziz",Toward professional standards for media transparency in the United States: Comparison of perceptions of non-transparency in national vs. regional media,"This article reports the results of the national survey of 287 Public Relations Society of America members regarding current media transparency practices in the United States. The purpose of the study was to understand the forms of media non-transparency that exist in the United States, levels of non-transparency at the national and local/regional media, and perceptions of non-transparent practices by the public relations practitioners in the country. The project builds on previous research on global media transparency (Tsetsura & Kruckeberg, 2011) and uses Tsetsura’s (2005) framework to study media transparency. The survey results showed that direct media bribery is not a pressing issue in the United States; however, indirect media pressures that involve new forms of content creation, including native advertising and content marketing, are worrisome. Specifically, forms of indirect media bribery are common at the local and regional media levels in the USA. Research findings demonstrate that U.S. practitioners experience particular non-transparent challenges when working with the media and recognize financial pressures that U.S. media outlets face today. The results provide a basis for creating standards in U.S. practice to ensure that new forms of content creation, including native advertising and content marketing, are not acceptable at any level when sources of content are not disclosed. The study concludes with the discussion about the importance of understanding how new forms of sponsored content relate to media transparency in the USA and why U.S. practitioners should understand how media non-transparency relates to the issues of native advertising and brand journalism.",academic_review,"Toward professional standards for media transparency in the United States: Comparison of perceptions of non-transparency in national vs. regional mediaThis article reports the results of the national survey of 287 Public Relations Society of America members regarding current media transparency practices in the United States.

Although Bourdieu is one of the most quoted sociologists in the world (Santoro, 2011; Truong & Weill, 2012), his work has only received limited attention in public relations, and has been entirely ignored within the context of activist communication. This is despite his focus on power, relationships and the role of activists in modern democracies, all of which are central themes in public relations practice and research. Based on Bourdieu’s theory of practice, the discipline’s prevailing, dominant, industry serving, functionalist paradigm positions public relations’ role in society as to perpetuate social inequalities. However, drawing on his ideas leads us to question if public relations skills could be equally utilized to challenge existing power imbalances in society, either in support or on behalf of those groups and individuals whose voices have been drowned out by traditional public relations efforts. The author argues that Bourdieu was not only an accomplished scholar, but also an activist in his own right. It is this combination of personal experience with academic ideas that lends weight to his scholarly work through which he urged the scholarly community to utilize their skills, knowledge and research to challenge (perceived) inequalities in society.

A survey of 342 public relations practitioners revealed that providing monetary gifts, performing formal responsibility, building informal relationships, receiving paid media coverage, and giving and accepting informal support were found to be significant subdimensions of media relations. After implementation of the anti-graft law, public relations practitioners expressed a belief that the practice of providing monetary gifts would shrink the most and that performing formal responsibility would experience the most growth. The formal responsibility factor was significantly positively related to support for the new law and public relations ethics, while giving and accepting informal support was negatively linked to public relations ethics. Paid media coverage showed a positive relationship with public relations practitioners’ perceptions about difficulties of increasing outputs of media relations. Finally, this empirical study shows how new external regulations arising from implementation of the anti-graft law can affect the personal influence model of media relations in Korea.",academic_review,"An exploratory study of transformed media relations dimensions after the implementation of an anti-graft law in KoreaThe Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, which went into effect on September 28, 2016, strictly prohibits gift giving to journalists, thereby making a traditional media relations practice in Korea illegal.

2018,3,Liang Ma,How to turn your friends into enemies: Causes and outcomes of customers’ sense of betrayal in crisis communication,"Crises are violations of customers’ expectations for a company. Loyal customers who feel betrayed due to the violations of expectations often become the company’s worst enemies. To extend the line of research of situational crisis communication theory (SCCT), this study explored how attributed responsibility, customer-company relationship (CCR), and their interaction affect betrayal. A company’s defining attributes and customer-company identification (CCI) shape customers’ expectations for a company. This study also examined how a direct threat to a company’s defining attribute in a crisis and CCI affect betrayal. A total of 395 Whole Foods customers participated in an online quasi-experiment. The antecedent concepts from SCCT all affect betrayal, with the attributed responsibility being the strongest predictor. Customers also feel more betrayed when the crisis directly threatens the company’s defining attribute and when they strongly identify with the company. Consequently, sense of betrayal has strong effects on customers’ attitudinal, emotional, and intentional responses.",academic_review,"How to turn your friends into enemies: Causes and outcomes of customers’ sense of betrayal in crisis communicationCrises are violations of customers’ expectations for a company.

Both Bourdieu and Burke were concerned with theoretical reductionism. I claim that Bourdieu could not help but be reductive insofar as his metaphor of capital became the totalizing lens through which he understood society. First, I review Bourdieu’s forms of capital, noting how capital serves as the sine qua non of his theory of practice. Second, I situate Bourdieu within the PR literature. Third, I read Bourdieu’s “capital” through Burke’s (1941) four master tropes.

Public figures are frequently advised to use social media platforms to apologize to publics, and their apologies are often posted by news outlets or individual social media users. However, evidence suggests social media may function on an interpersonal level, yet traditional image repair strategies are based on a mass media model. Using image repair strategies based in theoretical frameworks from mass mediated and interpersonal communication, this research examined the verbal behaviors and emotions displayed by public figures apologizing on YouTube and the relationships these had to audience perceptions of sincerity and forgiveness as expressed via YouTube comments. Two studies analyzed 335 segments of video from 32 public apologies on YouTube spanning from 2009 to 2014, and 1971 posted responses. The interpersonal strategies and expression of emotions were largely unrelated to the perceptions of sincerity and forgiveness; and the image repair strategies were limited in their relatedness. However, the content of the comments, a majority of which focused on the reputation of the public figure, was associated with perceptions of sincerity. Reducing offensiveness was associated with perceptions of insincerity, as was the combination of reducing offensiveness, denial and evasion. Negative comments regarding the offender’s reputation were also associated with perceptions of insincerity. Audiences were non-forgiving if the apology was perceived as insincere, but forgiving if they perceived the apology as sincere.

Pershing Square delivered a social gain, when the regulator intervened to levy a fine to redress the losses of Herbalife distributors and ordered the company to change its business practices. With this change in governance, Pershing Square achieved the type of social gain normally associated with social activism or corporate social responsibility. The case suggests that the economically-derived exit-voice-loyalty continuum is a useful theoretical frame for considering social gains arising from the public relations of activist investors.

Specifically, this study examines the emotional expression and crisis coping behaviors on social media during two separate terror attacks: the Paris terror attacks in 2015 and the Barcelona terror attacks in 2017. Results demonstrate how publics may be identified and understood through semantic network analysis and content analysis. This study also shows the connection between emotions and coping, expanding the crisis communication literature in public relations, and suggests the need to consider agenda-setting and resilience in crisis communication research. Finally, we discuss this study’s implications for assuming a dialogic orientation in public relations."

Thirty-eight interviews with chief communications officers (CCOs) and their counselors were conducted to explore what lasting lessons these corporate communication leaders learned from their crisis communication practice during the 2008 Financial Crisis. Key lessons learned include: 1) the importance for corporations to tailor their financial communication strategies according to victim vs. perpetrator perception and ethical response expectations held by stakeholders; 2) the importance of stakeholders, and employees in particular, when creating and implementing the plan; 3) the balance between speed and legal concerns, as well as the need for reducing complexity by making sure stakeholder communications are delivered with clarity and accessibility; and 4) a recipe for success includes honesty, transparency, trust/integrity, taking action to reform questionable practices, and abiding by one’s own personal morals.

Much of public relations crisis research focuses on how to respond after a crisis, but drawing on Expectation Violation Theory (EVT), this research focuses on the expectations of stakeholders before a crisis and how they process information during a crisis. Drawing from reputation management research in marketing, it conceptualizes corporate reputations as encompassing associations related to corporate ability (CA) and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Reputation management research generally has investigated reputations as strong on either CA or CSR, but this research examines the effects of a “hybrid” reputation, which is strong in terms of both CA and CSR associations. The results of an experiment reveal that stakeholders’ responses during a crisis vary based on their expectations, how they perceive a hybrid reputation, and the crisis type.

On the one hand, sharing-based narratives, heavily impacted by publics’ shared media coverage, reflected media crisis narratives and salient risk perceptions aligning with the news agenda. On the other hand, conversation-based narratives, fueled by publics’ opinion expression and emotional venting, demonstrated publics’ interpretations of their experience with the organization in the crisis with less salient but more diversified risk perceptions.

2018,5,John A. Fortunato,Understanding a non-causality crisis response: Examining the Florida Panthers response to Hurricane Irma,"Much of the crisis response literature focuses on an organization deemed to be responsible for the occurrence of the crisis. For a crisis without a singular organization causality, such as a natural disaster, any organization can proactively initiate actions to address the situation. This article contributes to the understanding of a non-causality crisis response by identifying the capabilities that an organization needs to effectively assist with the response. An organization must possess the requisite resources, have developed key stakeholder relationships, and be driven by its own values and sense of responsibility.

For a crisis without a singular organization causality, such as a natural disaster, any organization can proactively initiate actions to address the situation. This article contributes to the understanding of a non-causality crisis response by identifying the capabilities that an organization needs to effectively assist with the response. An organization must possess the requisite resources, have developed key stakeholder relationships, and be driven by its own values and sense of responsibility.

In particular, the effects of expressing discrete emotions with a single valence (either positive or negative) versus mixed valence (expressing both positive and negative emotions) emotions are studied by means of a 4 (emotional message framing: control vs. positive emotion vs. negative emotion vs. mixed valence emotions) by 2 (crisis type: victim vs. preventable crisis) between-subjects experimental design (N = 295). Results show that in a preventable crisis, expressing mixed valence emotions elicits higher perceived sincerity and more empathy towards the spokesperson, and subsequently less negative word-of-mouth compared to expressing either single emotions or the control condition. However, in the case of a victim crisis, expressing single emotions, and especially a negative emotion like anger, results in less negative word-of-mouth through an increase in perceived sincerity and empathy towards the spokesperson.",academic_review,"The impact of expressing mixed valence emotions in organizational crisis communication on consumer’s negative word-of-mouth intentionThis paper examines the impact of expressing different discrete emotions with a mixed valence (anger and hope) in organizational crisis communication on negative word-of-mouth on social media.

To date, however, a paucity of research has considered how content could facilitate stakeholder support and relationships in crisis communication. The findings show that when an organization commits to transparent, interactive dialogue during a social media crisis on a social media platform, stakeholders are pulled to authentic content because they are interested and actively seeking for relevant information. Dialogic content may also boost stakeholder support and encourage relationship building to help move the organization forward after the crisis with dialogic communication.

The core purpose of such rhetoric is to achieve a representation of reliability. Politicians who appear to change positions must do so in a way that does not make them seem unreliable to their key stakeholders. Strategies for achieving this goal fall into four primary categories: ignore, deny, justify, and repent.

However, no experiment has compared the group members’ perceptions when seeing their roles in action. Inspired by frameworks of social identity theory, intergroup deception, and the black sheep effect, we test how public relations practitioners and journalists respond to a crisis communication media interview. In our experiment, a company spokesperson either answers questions or engages in stereotypical “spin,” which journalists historically consider one of the most offensive public relations strategies. Results indicate that public relations practitioners align with journalists in their perceptions of a spokesperson’s trustworthiness and the organization’s trustworthiness across treatment conditions. Practitioners also manifest the black sheep effect, disliking their group representative engaging in deception. Furthermore, we explore whether the effects on perceptions of trustworthiness are moderated by psychological identification with their respective industry. Discussion concerns the theoretical and practical ramifications of the groups sharing ingroup affiliation, contrary to prevailing notions of acrimony.",academic_review,"Do public relations practitioners perceptually share ingroup affiliation with journalists?Upwards of 200 studies over the past hundred years have reported on the relationship between public relations practitioners and journalists.

2019,2,Øystein Pedersen Dahlen,Modernity and the development of PR in Norway: Influences and interactions,"This article examines the relationship between Norwegian PR history and the development of modernity. The theoretical starting point is based on historical sociology and especially theories of modernity as formulated by Anthony Giddens and Jürgen Habermas. The study concerns the period from 1800 to 1913, where Norway may be defined as a modern capitalist society. The study shows that there is a mutual interaction between PR history and the development of modernity in Norway: in the same way that PR is a product of modernity, PR activities are also important for the development of modernity. Basic concepts in this development are rationalism (science and technology), nationalism, parliament, law/justice, democratisation, freedom of speech, public spheres, individualism, elitism, discipline/control, civil society, capitalism, industrialism, political parties, and mass participation in politics.",academic_review,"Modernity and the development of PR in Norway: Influences and interactionsThis article examines the relationship between Norwegian PR history and the development of modernity.

2019,2,Anne Gregory,UK Government Communication: The Cameron years and their ongoing legacy,"This paper chronicles in detail, analyses and draws conclusions about the development of the UK Government Communication Service (GCS) from the election of the Coalition Government led by David Cameron in May 2010, to his resignation following the referendum vote to leave the European Union (EU) on 23rd June 2016. Looking at the radical changes introduced within a historical context, the paper also provides a conceptual model of Government communication from the point where it became a recognisably government-wide service in 1956 to the period under examination. The methodological approach to this paper is qualitative using case study as the main method. A variety of data collection methods were used: ethnographic, including non-participant and participant observation, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with six senior managers in the Government Communication Service (GCS), five senior operational managers and two external experts. This primary research is supplemented by secondary sources including the academic literature and Government papers most of which are in the public domain, but some of which the author had privileged access to. Context is provided through an overview of the challenges facing the UK Government in the recent past and currently, a brief literature review and background on the philosophy and origins of Government Communication in the UK along with changes in the civil service more broadly. Then the structural and operational changes introduced During the Cameron years are presented. These changes, their impact and implications are discussed in context and conclusions drawn.

However, the process itself and the consequences differed immensely from state to state: e.g., from peaceful so-called Velvet Revolution in former Czechoslovakia to the brutal civil war in former Yugoslavia. Our aim was to analyze the preconditions of the political and societal change in the Czechoslovak media – were there any signs of the change? How did the ruling party present the Soviet perestroika, which signalized a step towards democratization? The nomenklatura (ruling elite) was rather surprised by Gorbachev’s plans and feared the resemblance with the Prague Spring 1968. Nevertheless, they had to comply with the official Soviet dictate. We used Wodak’s discoursive–historical approach to analyze official propaganda reports and press agency news. We found that the Czechoslovak official nomenklatura used several argumentation and persuasive strategies to present perestroika not as a political change, but as an ongoing path towards Communism. Perestroika was presented as an accelerated path towards a classless society, however, the words were often vague or meaningless. We show that the nomenklatura welcomed perestroika verbally, but the disparity between the words and actions was omnipresent. Citizens could “read between the lines”, which meant that they revealed inner inconsistencies and problems of the regime from discoursive strategies. The aim to communicate perestroika thus served merely as an evidence of the inner disintegration of the system.",academic_review,"Propaganda stories in Czechoslovakia in the late 1980s: Believe it or not?The collapse of the communist totalitarian regimes in Eastern and Central Europe and the end of the Cold War is one of key historical milestones in the history of the 20th century.

Existing accounts of the emergence of government public relations in the UK have tended to focus on the civil service in the first half of the twentieth century, but this article sheds light on a series of earlier developments, including the allocation of seats for reporters in the viewing gallery of the Commons in 1803, the construction of dedicated Reporters’ Galleries in both parliamentary chambers in 1847–52 and the creation of a Westminster Lobby in 1884. Taken together, these reforms improved journalists’ access to parliament in an era in which direct governmental control over newspapers lapsed. Yet, they also allowed politicians to influence media commentary by determining who was permitted access to parliament and what type of content made its way into print. A case can thus be made that Westminster, not Whitehall, played host to the earliest official attempts to manage the media in Britain, and this has important repercussions for current understandings of public relations history.",academic_review,"‘What the country wanted’: The houses of parliament, the press and the origins of media management in Britain, c. 1780–1900This paper considers a topic that has received scant attention in the historiography of public relations: official attempts to manage the press in Britain in the Houses of Parliament in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

This study reflects on how the GPRD’s practices have been affected by the country’s governing and political environments over time. It has periodized the eighty-four-years of development of the GPRD into sequential phases based on a continuum approach. The GPRD’s roles and duties are detailed based on four periods: Beginning Period, Growth Period, Full Expansion Period, and Weak Period. The GPRD was firstly positioned to be the primary government tool for introducing the concept of democracy to the Thai populace and disseminating information about government policies, activities and propagandistic campaigns. Through Thailand’s periods of political instability, World War II, the Cold War and rise of communism in Indochina, globalization, and the current digital age, the GPRD has expanded in its role within the government as the center of communication for a wide variety of governmental organizations. However, even as it has expanded and undergone re-organization, it has been criticized for being a government mouthpiece rather that a reliable source of factual information. Working under the direct oversight of the various governments led by the military, as well as both appointed and elected politicians, the GPRD has struggled to maintain a balanced public relations role at the juncture of Thai politics and public interest.",academic_review,"The never changing story: Eight decades of the government public relations department of ThailandThe Government Public Relations Department (GPRD) of Thailand has existed in various forms since the country’s governing system changed from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one in 1932.

The author argues that Thorold Dickinson used the documentary to make a radical public information proposition to a global audience on behalf of the United Nations.

In particular, we examine how they managed to be powerfully democratic through an imaginative sensitivity to the voices of people often excluded from history; through grounding research in specific, often small, localities, and communities; and paradoxically, managing to avoid enough of the insularity associated with the notorious “little Britain” mindset to attract interest and interactions from historians across the world. Our article highlights the relevance to PR history of the following four aspects: 1) their awareness of the need to interact locally and beyond national boundaries; 2) their concern for inclusion (especially for subjects excluded or marginalized in earlier historical accounts); 3) their strategies for escaping insularity and increasing interdisciplinarity; and 4) their illustrations of imagination as a vital component in historical writing. For contemporary PR history writing we argue: that the first aspect, the fusion of the local with the post-national, has become a necessity as globalization keeps expanding; that the second, strategic inclusiveness, has urgency for a field reflecting on the social shortcomings of its own organization-centered past; that the third, interdisciplinary, has intensified in utility as fields adapt to the massive growth in different kinds of knowledge (from big data to neuroscience); and that the fourth, passionate and engaged imagination, is needed for revisionist accounts of the past to help reclaim more prosocial futures.",academic_review,"Creatively escaping insularity and encouraging internationalism: British radicalism, history from below, and public relations historiographyIn this article, we examine what PR history can learn from a small but internationally influential group of radical historians in Britain.

However, the extant research has studied civil society networks of NGOs, donors, and the media in transitional countries. This study extends the public relations model of civil society in two ways. First, it broadens the scope to an international context. Second, it draws from the multi-stakeholder issue network perspective to conceptualize a civil society network as a space where stakeholders of an issue mix their interests as they collectively address a pressing public issue. The literature on international and multi-stakeholder networks suggest that the international scope and the mixing of interests across sectors may restrict the production of social capital. The results from the social network analysis suggests that the mixing of interests across sectoral and geopolitical boundaries did not restrict the production of social capital. Rather, the patterns of the relationships among those on the core and those on the periphery of the network restricted the production of social capital.

The investment model provides a suitable framework to explain publics’ commitment to an organization, with explained variance more than 90 percent, and an organization’s relationship maintenance strategies during and post-crisis significantly affect publics’ trust. Whether an organization’s relationships with the publics can be maintained or repaired depends on whether an organization engages in these relationship maintenance strategies that prioritize publics’ need, which can be reciprocated from publics as publics reorient themselves along with the long-term goals and well-being of the relationships.

2019,3,Petra Theunissen,Extending public relationship-building through the theory of politeness,"For more than thirty years, relationship-building has been recognized as central to public relations, and yet, exactly how practitioners go about building and maintaining relationships at the micro level has been insufficiently explored in public relations scholarship. Politeness, or a lack thereof, is ever-present in all communicative interactions, affecting the formation and development of relationships. There is therefore value in extending our understanding of how these relationships are impacted by (im)polite communicative acts. Principally, politeness attempts to balance participants’ face needs or needs for self-esteem through employing various strategies, and this article attempts to explicate the theory of politeness for public relations work. It concludes that an understanding of the fundamentals of politeness theory and strategies enables practitioners to be more effective at building relationships within and across communities, avoiding potential pragmatic failure.",academic_review,"Extending public relationship-building through the theory of politenessFor more than thirty years, relationship-building has been recognized as central to public relations, and yet, exactly how practitioners go about building and maintaining relationships at the micro level has been insufficiently explored in public relations scholarship.

The study focusses on the personal experiences of PR leaders and considers how exploring the interplay between a leader and their context enhances understanding of the conditions under which knowledge is enacted, or rather not enacted, in different leadership situations. The discussion is informed by perspectives from organization and leadership studies which highlight the importance of reflexivity to leadership learning. In addition to applying a reflexive lens to leadership practice in public relations, the study addresses a lack of empirical research focussing on the situated experiences of PR leaders. It considers the reflexive potential of a programme of interviews with PR practitioners providing examples to illustrate the role this form of research can play in leadership studies. The context investigated concerns the work place experiences of senior PR executives who claim to be ‘empowering leaders’. The discussion of the findings focuses on how organizational power relations distort the practitioners’ espoused leadership values and engages in a process of problematization designed to challenge the uncritical promotion of normative and decontextualised approaches to leadership. The article highlights the benefits of a reflexive orientation to PR leadership research and pedagogy, while calling for the promotion of a particular form of contextual intelligence to help practitioners confront the organizational conditions which specifically impact on their ability to lead others.",academic_review,"From knowing to doing: Reflexivity, leadership and public relationsThis article argues that little is known in public relations (PR) about the experience of leadership and, more specifically, the challenges associated with enacting desired leadership behaviours in the work place.

It also uses market-size, organization, and individual level predictors to model Instagram postings. A content analysis of 1502 posts revealed the banks use Instagram for promotion, information dissemination, community building, and interactive engagement, in that order of prominence. The findings suggest banks operate at the confluence of visual communication through Instagram and integration of religious symbolism to serve a public relations function predicated on image and influence. In doing so, the banks tap into the wellspring of social media use by target publics by navigating a balance between obedience to Allah and meeting bank business objectives. The resulting tension between sacred and secular highlights Arab cultural values and suggests Instagram fosters individualism, which challenges Arab emphasis on collectivism and fractures the notion online platforms can effectively build meaningful relationships that characterize Arab culture.

Not well understood is how and why such co-creation modifies shared meaning, amplifies change, and even “erases” some piece of memory from the public record with the purpose of redirecting and redefining societal narratives. To help establish erasure as a concept for studying public relations, we draw from Freud’s theory of memory to establish a foundation upon which to critique strategic erasure. We adapt Freud’s theory of memory into the intersecting critique of visual rhetoric as public relations by analyzing, via narrative inquiry, remnants of Imperial Rome that have been modified, amplified, but even erased to present Rome’s modern identity. For centuries, even during Imperial Rome, leaders practiced damnatio memoriae —a modern Latin phrase that means “condemnation of memory.” We use this concept to interrogate the public relations identity process Rome’s leaders have used to modify for emphasis and even obliterate Roman elites’ names and images from the texts of public records by destroying, mutilating and modifying statues and monuments as a means for co-creating new public memory. Such analysis reveals how damnatio memoriae helps elites to redefine the “memory” of the Eternal City.",academic_review,"The public relations paradox of erasure: Damnatio memoriae as public relations strategy and tacticPublic relations scholars study how organizations co-create meaning with engaged stakeholders.

Specifically, firms maintaining robust cross-sector portfolios had more extensive networks with organizations in the nonprofit and public sectors than firms maintaining limited cross-sector portfolios.

The essay also discusses the theoretical inquiries needed to further dual-projection networks, and invites scholars to create novel ways to incorporate publics into their network studies using dual projection."
2019,4,Juliana Raupp,Crisis communication in the rhetorical arena,"This study applies and extends the rhetorical arena theory (RAT) of crisis communication with a network analysis. Taking the Volkswagen emission crisis as a case in point, the media discourse in two German and two US-based newspapers was analyzed. Patterns of interaction between various voices that co-construct the rhetorical crisis situation were examined using a relational analysis of statements. A symbolic network was constructed that consisted of rhetorical relations between the actors. The findings show that VW is by far the most prominent voice in the media coverage. However, this prominence is based on the fact that VW mainly appears in the role of the addressee of statements, and that many of the corporation’s statements are self-referential. Politicians and public authorities, as well as experts, have a good chance to actively have their say. Affected stakeholders and NGOs, on the other hand, barely got an opportunity to speak. Overall, the media discourse appears to be dominated by a few high-ranking actors, and the roles and power relationships are distributed very unevenly. Implications of this imbalance in media discourse are discussed, and suggestions for further research are made.",academic_review,"Crisis communication in the rhetorical arenaThis study applies and extends the rhetorical arena theory (RAT) of crisis communication with a network analysis.

Taking a multi-iteration consensus-building approach, this study enabled the expert panel to individually elaborate and collectively evaluate shared observations and insights regarding trends, patterns, and nuances in crisis communication as a unique interdisciplinary area of research and practice. The quality and impact of current scholarship, methodological rigor and diversity, and perceived knowledge gaps between academia and industry were compared and synthesized across countries. Consensus was achieved in the majority of the proposed questions. Results show challenges and particular deficiencies within the crisis communication research domain. The main challenge is bridging the gap between academia and industry. The lack of theory development and cross-cultural studies contribute to part of this challenge.

Taking a multi-iteration consensus-building approach, this study enabled the expert panel to individually elaborate and collectively evaluate shared observations and insights regarding trends, patterns, and nuances in crisis communication as a unique interdisciplinary area of research and practice. The quality and impact of current scholarship, methodological rigor and diversity, and perceived knowledge gaps between academia and industry were compared and synthesized across countries. Consensus was achieved in the majority of the proposed questions. Results show challenges and particular deficiencies within the crisis communication research domain. The main challenge is bridging the gap between academia and industry. The lack of theory development and cross-cultural studies contribute to part of this challenge.

That paradigm reasons that narratives provide enactable continuity that binds the past, present, and future to culturally guide coordinated discourse and action. How statues and monuments are important to that end can be demonstrated by public relations practice in the United States: Post-Civil War to today. To develop that theme, this paper discusses how statues and monuments serve as textual resources that bind time and moralize behavior through commemoration/counter commemoration. As an intersection with narrative theory, epideictic rhetoric has celebrated (or condemned) citizenship actions that reflect and define moral behavior. Such rhetoric uses moral standards to judge acts, and advocates acts as worthy of praise as they exemplify moral standards. If standards change, acts that once were lauded can become condemned as unworthy of praise.

Most frameworks and models which have gained recognition in the academy and practice follow programme logic methodology. They also point to the achievement of organisational objectives as being the principal, but not always sole, purpose of public relations programmes. The achievement of organisational objectives has therefore been the focus of evaluation. Parallel, to this, a second strand of thinking in the scholarship and practice has questioned the assumption that the meeting of organisational objectives is paramount and whether organisations alone should determine the measures of success. Other perspectives such as stakeholder judgements of success and the obligation of organisations to meet societal expectations have been discussed as legitimate ways in which to evaluate programmes and activities. This paper takes forward this second strand by proposing that the evaluation debate should be ‘flipped’. Instead of organisational objectives being a primary denominator for evaluation, the paper proposes that whether organisations discharge their accountabilities to stakeholders and society is of equal, if not more weight. An organisation will succeed only if it sustains its licence to operate. To achieve that it has to meet the reasonable expectations that licence-givers have and to obtain their active consent to support its actions. The key questions for public relations are therefore: who/what holds us to account? What are their expectations? How are their expectations fulfilled? Drawing on the management and public relations literature to answer these questions, the paper calls for a radical ‘turn’ from the prevailing thinking, which the authors suggest is more about public relations explaining and justifying itself, towards a model that aligns with contemporary management thinking and practice. The paper proposes a model and process that provides a way forwards based not only on organisational aspirations, but on a hierarchy of obligations: to society, stakeholders, the organisation, and to the professional function which runs campaigns. It offers a principles based evaluation approach. In doing so, it takes the evaluation debate in a new direction and thereby adds to theory-building. It also offers a new way forwards for the practice which has become increasingly mired in developing more comprehensive lists of indicators and metrics and expanding taxonomies of evaluation terms.",academic_review,"An evaluation u-turn: From narrow organisational objectives to broad accountabilityThe development of evaluation scholarship progresses, but the slow and incremental steps taken are largely refinements on a direction of thinking that has become established and virtually taken for granted.

Because the goal of this research was to analyze the public thought leadership of public relations agencies as displayed on their websites (not agency-client relationships), both quantitative and qualitative content analyses were carried out to examine their website content. The purpose was to identify whether agencies’ ethical counsel and leadership were demonstrated; and, if they were, through which approaches and themes. Public relations agencies discussed the Trump victory in a few ways. The most popular theme was the Columnist/Blogger/Critic approach, or a personalized reflection of agency staffers on the Trump victory. The second most popular--yet less frequent--approach was as PR Counsel, aimed at providing professional advice to prepare brands for Trump’s attacks and/or take advantages of new opportunities in the Trump era. The third most popular – the Expert approach – was an in-depth analysis of an issue (for example, health care) and a Trump presidency’s implications. This study addresses implications for risk management in the political sphere of public relations. The response of the public relations industry, as evidenced on agency websites, was less than strategic: We do not practice what we preach (or sell).

Additionally, if public relations professionals understand how the public perceives CSV, they can give a strategic perspective to top management for maximizing moral capabilities of the business and formulate effective communication to promote CSV initiatives. This study investigates whether the public prefers corporations to practice CSV as opposed to intrinsic CSR as a separate pursuit from business interests. It also explores the role of leadership as an influential and ethical construct in implementing effective CSV as perceived by the public. The public’s preference for CSV over intrinsic CSR was revealed in a survey of 1784 participants in the United States (US), Germany, and China. Factor analysis results further suggested that effective CSV competencies of CEOs were construed as a unidimensional concept in the US, but German and Chinese participants viewed it as two-dimensional.

On the one hand, religious sociologists emphasise the importance of face-to-face communication for religious groups, to maintain authenticity and plausibility structures (especially in a pluralistic and secular world). On the other hand, media and communication scholars underline the opportunities to be found within mediated communication. This leads to the question of whether the churches’ communication with their members has shifted from face-to-face communication to more mediated communication. A comparative case study based on a multi-level mixed method design provides insights into the membership communication of the two major German denominations (Protestant and Catholic). The findings illustrate a clear shift from face-to-face to mediated communication at the upper church levels.

A total of 4068 respondents from mainland China completed questionnaires. Results demonstrated that institutional responsiveness indirectly reduced publics’ destructive non-institutional political participation by building institutional trust. Extending the public relations literature on dialogue, we found that this indirect relationship is conditional on online political information seeking rather than online political expression among members of the public. For people who frequently use the Internet to seek political information, institutional responsiveness is more likely to boost institutional trust, which decreases the likelihood of participation in offline political activities.",academic_review,"How responsiveness works in mainland China: Effects on institutional trust and political participationThis study investigated whether and how institutional responsiveness, a constitutive element of dialogic communication, influences institutional trust and political participation among members of the public in mainland China.

A 2 (crowdsourcing vs. non-crowdsourcing) × 2 (trust vs. distrust) between-subjects experiment was conducted using real company names. The results show that trust generated a higher perception of dialogic communication, CSR, and company evaluations than distrust. We also identify accessibility and grounding as the dialogic communication outcomes induced by crowdsourced CSR. A moderated mediation test shows that crowdsourced CSR leads to positive evaluations only when conducted by a trusted company through accessibility/grounding.

2020,1,"Uta Russmann, Anne B. Lane",Mandating dialogue? International perspectives on differences between theory and practice,"This paper replicates an Australian study (Lane, 2018) into how public relations practitioners understand dialogue in practice. The original study found practitioners believed they were carrying out dialogue legally required by government, but what they were doing was no more than two-way communication. It also found practitioners’ operating environments meant they could never actually undertake dialogue, even if mandated to do so. These empirically-based insights revealed the existence of gaps between theory and practice in dialogue in public relations. The study was repeated in Austria to determine if these findings were consistent internationally, and to consider what this might mean for the place of dialogue in public relations. Examples of so-called mandated ‘dialogue’ provided by Austrian public relations practitioners in semi-structured interviews were analyzed using Kent and Taylor’s (2002) five principles of dialogue. This analysis showed that despite the Austrian practitioners’ familiarity with the work of Habermas on dialogue, the mandated communication they carried out was not dialogue. The Austrian experience also showed that the nature of the underlying context of mandated communication—the need to achieve agreement between parties in varying levels of conflict; and conducting communication within boundaries of time and non-negotiable pre-existing decisions—meant dialogue could never occur. Comparing the two studies demonstrated high levels of similarity between the countries’ results, which we hope can provide the starting point for the development of a longitudinal and international perspective. This paper concludes that the place of dialogue in the theory and practice of public relations is dependent on the education of practitioners in its implementation; and a re-thinking of the role of the aspirational in situations where it can never be attained.",academic_review,"Mandating dialogue?

2020,1,"Mohan J. Dutta, Steve Elers","Public relations, indigeneity and colonization: Indigenous resistance as dialogic anchor","Cultural communication has been put forth in the context of globalization and the emergence of Indigenous movements as a framework for dialogue to be carried out by organizations (Love & Tilley, 2014). Concepts of Māori communication for instance have been foregrounded in the public relations literature to anchor strategies of effective engagement through dialogue, leading to the building of trust in Indigenous communities (Love & Tilley, 2014). Similarly, Indigenous engagement has been foregrounded as a key resource in achieving global sustainable development (Dutta, 2013, 2019). This turn to Indigenous cultural communication is broadly situated in the framing of indigeneity as a category to be developed within frameworks of dialogue and engagement, constituted within the structures of transnational capitalism (Dutta, 2019). Drawing from Dutta’s (2008) theorizing of the cultural sensitivity and culture-centered approaches to communication, we critically interrogate the hegemony of Indigenous dialogue as a strategy deployed by dominant organizations. Whereas cultural sensitivity incorporates cultural characteristics to serve organizational goals, cultural-centering serves as an anchor for collaborating with cultural communities at the margins in building “communicative infrastructures” for voice. Arguing that superficial markers of culture incorporated into engagement is a communicative inversion that serves the colonizing tools of transnational capital, we attend to culturally centered communication strategies of engagement that are grounded in resistance and emerge from within the voices of Indigenous movements that are increasingly threatened by ever-expanding colonial missions of globalization. Comparing across two case studies, one about the struggle of the Dongria Kondh in the Odisha state of Eastern India against mining capitalism, and the other a critical review of the use of Māori cultural knowledge in the public relations literature, we articulate indigeneity as a site of resistance within the meta-theoretical framework of the culture-centered approach (Dutta, 2008, 2011). In conceptualizing Indigenous resistance as an agonistic anchor to communication, we attend to the impossibilities of dialogue, and simultaneously to the role of communicative infrastructures in inverting neoliberal hegemony. Dialogue is radically transformed, not in generating consensus but rather in its capacity to disrupt the neoliberal status quo through the presence of Indigenous voices. Indigenous resistance “renders impure” the ontological category of dialogue, on one hand, attending to the limits of dialogue, and on the other hand, turns dialogic tools into the hands of Indigenous social movements.

To shed light on the participants involved in politicized consumer activism, the present study includes a public segmentation analysis of a case in a Chinese context. Building on the situational theory of publics (STP), this study incorporates three objective resources—economic, social, and cultural capital—as segmenting criteria. Data were collected by sending out self-administered questionnaires, resulting in 450 valid and complete questionnaires. A two-step cluster analysis identified three segments: the inactive unprivileged group (cluster 1), the moderate elites (cluster 2), and the active middle class (cluster 3). The degree of activism was lowest in cluster 1 and highest in cluster 3.

The clearer and more consistent conceptualization of dialogue resulting from the dialogic ladder will assist in developing teaching curricula and associated materials that enable future researchers and practitioners to distinguish between true Dialogue and other forms. The dialogic ladder contributes to the development of dialogue theory that either expands to include dialogue-in-name-only (Kent & Theunissen, 2016), or narrows its focus to consider only true Dialogue. It will also allow identification of situations in practice where two-way communication falls short of true Dialogue, and stimulate efforts to consider why this shortfall occurs and how it might be addressed—if the conduct of true Dialogue is deemed necessary and possible.

The key tenets of this paradigm are deployed to enable some critical reflection on the value of the model, and particularly the work of Heath, for scholars who accept that public relations is constituted by persuasive discourses and perpetual competition between opposing interests and values. The second aim of this paper is to explore the question of where next? How do we develop the rhetorical paradigm and take it into new directions and allow it to embrace new problems? This paper will attempt to do this by applying agonistic theories of democracy. To mirror how Heath has drawn on classical writers such as Aristotle, Isocrates and Quintilian, this paper will also draw on classical texts: Firstly, through the satirical drama and social commentary in the writing of Aristophanes; and then through Honig’s work in reinterpreting Sophocles’ play Antigone. Agonism derives from the ancient Greek word agōn - a contest or struggle. A key priniciple of classical agonism is that protagonists should seek to win acclaim and admiration by performing openly in public, and it extols plurality above dispassionate deliberation. This suggests some resonance with the dominant assumptions of the rhetorical paradigm, but more modern forms of agonism make post-foundationalist assumptions of the impossibility of any consensus existing beyond precarious hegemonic relationships. They also hold to a radical pluralism that when applied challenge widely-held assumptions that ethically grounded public relations practice is that which seeks to eliminate conflict in favour of seeking consensus.

2020,1,"Yeunjae Lee, Weiting Tao",Employees as information influencers of organization’s CSR practices: The impacts of employee words on public perceptions of CSR,"This study investigates the impact of employees’ words about their organization’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities on external publics’ attitudes and behaviors toward the organization. Specifically, it examines how the valence (positive vs. negative) of employees’ words regarding a CSR campaign interacts with the type of channel (face-to-face vs. social media) of employees’ communication behaviors, and how these factors affect external publics’ perceived authenticity of the organization’s CSR, corporate attitudes, and purchasing intentions, respectively. An online experiment among 221 general consumers in the United States was conducted. The results demonstrated that negative messages regarding CSR distributed by employees in face-to-face communication decreased publics’ favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions to a greater extent than that distributed via social media (i.e., Facebook).

An online experiment among 221 general consumers in the United States was conducted. The results demonstrated that negative messages regarding CSR distributed by employees in face-to-face communication decreased publics’ favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions to a greater extent than that distributed via social media (i.e., Facebook).

More specifically, the study attempts to assess the role of government communication in shaping the international agenda regarding the crash vis-à-vis the role of Polish and Russian media outlets which also served as information sources for international media. In addition, it examines politico-cultural proximity and economic relatedness as the factors influencing the outcomes of mediated public diplomacy efforts. The findings suggest that, in addition to the governments’ public relations messages, Polish and Russian news outlets played a significant role as their countries’ advocates in determining the international media agenda. Moreover, we found that it was economic relatedness rather than the similarity of culture or political systems that contributed to the success of governments in shaping the international agenda about the crash.

This study empirically tests these assertions by examining how media reports of near-miss affect organizational trustworthiness and how trust repair strategies after a near-miss influence organizational and industry trust and technology acceptance in the emerging commercial industry of unmanned aircraft. Notwithstanding parallels to paracrisis, near-miss communication is understudied in public relations research. Further, studies of trust in the context of crisis are recent (see Brühl et al., 2018; Fuoli et al., 2017), and have produced unexpected results that warrant continued exploration in public relations.

This article argues that the rise of big-data in public relations is a hegemonic development that further re-enforces the current institutional logics and power in the three main spheres of society: corporate, governance and civic. Using the economic notion of externalities, the authors argue that loss of agency over personal data is the unpriced, unrecognized externality that drives the big-data market. This externality is dependent on those who are the losers of agency not having the requisite information, power or resources to negotiate alternatives that might re-dress the balance. As users and proponents of the use of big data, the public relations profession has a number of key questions to answer if it is not to re-inforce arguments that it is a hegemonizing force in organizations and society. Normal economic remedies to address externalities are not adequate to a case that is both ethical as well as economic in nature.

Using the social network approach, this study examines a network structure which emerged around boycotting and advocating for Starbucks and Budweiser when these two brands responded to President Donald Trump’s immigration ban executive order in 2017. The study identified three unique characteristics in the boycotters’ networks. The boycotters appeared not only in the aggregated brand boycotting networks, but also in the advocators’ networks. In addition, boycotters in Budweiser and Starbucks networks were engaged in boycotting other brands or organizations which were opposed to Republicans or President Trump’s policy.

The meta-analysis of 8 studies (k = 22, n = 3209, combined n = 9703) compared the impact of social media vs. traditional media in crisis communication. Five studies (n = 1896) contained 8 relevant effect sizes on crisis responsibility, representing 3294 individuals. Seven studies (n = 3185) contained 14 relevant effect sizes on persuasiveness, representing 6409 individuals. Compared to traditional media, using social media significantly lessened consumers’ perceived crisis responsibility (r = -.134, 95 % CI -.212– -.054, p =  .001). There was no significant difference between using traditional media and social media in crisis communication on persuasiveness (r = -.039, 95 % CI -.114– .035, p =  .30). The moderator analysis indicated that for both crisis responsibility and persuasiveness, the effect size was more noticeable when an organization communicates with college students vs. non-student publics. The ability of social media in dampening crisis responsibility was more pronounced for fictitious organizations compared to real organizations. Compared to traditional media, social media was significantly more negative for preventable crisis, the influence was weak for accidental crisis.

Ethical frameworks explicated by previous scholars to assess standards of the profession are used as a theoretical lens to consider the social responsibility implications of using Facebook for public relations. The social media environment is changing quickly, which calls for consideration of unintended impacts.",academic_review,"Social media ethics in the data economy: Issues of social responsibility for using Facebook for public relationsThe rapidly-evolving data economy based on surveillance capitalism raises new issues of ethics and social responsibility for public relations practice and scholarship.

McKeever, Denise Bortree",Examining the rage donation trend: Applying the anger activism model to explore communication and donation behaviors,"A national survey (N = 1275) explored how individuals’ anger and efficacy predict attitudes toward political and social activism, related communication behaviors, and financial support behaviors. Findings revealed partial support for the Anger Activism Model, which was tested in this unique context. Efficacy emerged as a stronger predictor compared to anger, and path analysis suggests that while anger directly predicts attitudes and communication behaviors, it also partially predicts efficacy.",academic_review,"Examining the rage donation trend: Applying the anger activism model to explore communication and donation behaviorsA national survey (N = 1275) explored how individuals’ anger and efficacy predict attitudes toward political and social activism, related communication behaviors, and financial support behaviors.

2020,5,"Danielle Quichocho, Burton St. John",The Emulation of Conversation: The Public Relations Case against Proposition 112 as a Spectrum of Persuasion,"In 2018, the fracking industry in Colorado embarked on a public relations initiative to defeat Proposition 112, a measure that the industry saw as an existential threat. This study reviewed the messaging used by the fracking industry and its supporters, examining 1,515 text articles (e.g., news accounts, op-eds, etc.) and also 38 Facebook posts from pro-fracking groups. Using Schudson’s (1997) binary framework for public talk, we found that public relations messaging often moved beyond the two realms of problem-solving and sociable messaging. In this case, pro-fracking interests emulated public talk, or conversation, by also offering a blend of problem-solving and sociable talk, what this study calls an “interface” point between Schudson’s binary. This case study found this interface point to be characterized by cohesion messages, or messages that emphasized to audiences that the well-being of fracking operations and Colorado communities were interwoven. This study’s findings point to implications regarding how public relations can attempt to emulate public talk across a spectrum so as to influence democratic deliberation on contemporary issues.",academic_review,"The Emulation of Conversation: The Public Relations Case against Proposition 112 as a Spectrum of PersuasionIn 2018, the fracking industry in Colorado embarked on a public relations initiative to defeat Proposition 112, a measure that the industry saw as an existential threat.

2020,5,"Xueying Zhang, Ziyuan Zhou",Do instructing and adjusting information make a difference in crisis responsibility attribution? Merging fear appeal studies with the defensive attribution hypothesis,"Guided by fear appeal effect theories and the defensive attribution hypothesis, the current study examined the influence of the threat and efficacy messages in instructing and adjusting information on crisis responsibility and organizational reputation. Study 1 adopted a 2 (high vs. low threat in instructing information) × 2 (high vs. low self efficacy for instructing information) × 2 (high vs. low proxy efficacy for adjusting information) experiment and revealed that the high threat message significantly increased the attribution of crisis responsibility and further harmed organizational reputation. The high proxy efficacy message in adjusting information helped protect the organizational reputation, however, the effect was not mediated by crisis responsibility. Study 2 replicated the first experiment using a different crisis and introduced fear to the research model. Conclusions in Study 1 were largely reinforced. Fear was observed to indirectly influence organizational reputation via crisis responsibility. The mixed results of threat and efficacy in instructing and adjusting information encouraged managerial considerations when organizations design initial crisis responses.",academic_review,"Do instructing and adjusting information make a difference in crisis responsibility attribution?

2020,5,"Clare Davies, Mitchell Hobbs",Irresistible possibilities: Examining the uses and consequences of social media influencers for contemporary public relations,"The proliferation of social media technologies have seen public relations practitioners adapt their practices for the emergent digital media ecologies, with the growing phenomenon of social media influencers (SMIs) presenting new opportunities and challenges for the industry. Indeed, the profession’s rapid adoption of SMIs as part of their campaigns raises questions regarding the ethics of their use and the extent to which they fit with normative models of public relations practice that promote genuine dialogue and responsible advocacy. This study explores this tension between the uses and potential misuses of SMIs by examining the worldviews, strategies and practices of senior public relations practitioners at several agencies in Sydney, Australia. It proposes a new critical framework for understanding the influences that SMIs are in fact having on public relations practice, which builds on models of dialogic public relations and a critical eco-systems perspective. Ultimately, this study argues that the affordances provided by the emergence of SMIs are predisposing practitioners to persuasive strategies and covert activities that lack transparency and are inconsistent with ethical ideals of best practice for organizational public relations.",academic_review,"Irresistible possibilities: Examining the uses and consequences of social media influencers for contemporary public relationsThe proliferation of social media technologies have seen public relations practitioners adapt their practices for the emergent digital media ecologies, with the growing phenomenon of social media influencers (SMIs) presenting new opportunities and challenges for the industry.
