How Female Practitioners Construct the Profession This study examined how female practitioners' discourses shape perceptions of public relations as an emerging field in Russia. Interviews with 25 practitioners from Moscow public relations agencies showed that a prism of a real job and a woman's job can help explain how socio-economic, professional, and gender-defined contexts influence practitioners' perceptions of public relations and provided evidence for understanding public relations as a socially constructed gendered profession. The study found that Russian women construct their professional identities in gendered ways that may limit their career opportunities.","real job female practitioners construct profession female practitioners discourses shape perceptions emerging field russia interviews practitioners moscow agencies prism real job womans job help explain socioeconomic professional genderdefined contexts influence practitioners perceptions provided evidence socially constructed gendered profession russian women construct professional identities gendered ways limit career opportunities"

Systematic analysis of the interview data identified multiple dimensions of ethical leadership and ethical knowledge, and suggested that ethical leadership is grounded in personal rather than professional characteristics. Personal ethics, interpersonal behaviors, and articulation of ethical standards emerged as 3 salient characteristics of an ideal leader in facilitating knowledge transfer of ethics in public relations organizations. Ethical knowledge is implicit, intangible, personal, and often difficult to identify or articulate, posing a challenge for the transfer of knowledge through structured and formalized approaches. Theoretical implications and practical recommendations are discussed.","characteristics dimensions ethical leadership characteristics leadership developing managing ethics depth interviews executives united states systematic interview data identified multiple dimensions ethical leadership ethical knowledge suggested ethical leadership grounded personal professional characteristics personal ethics interpersonal behaviors articulation ethical standards emerged salient characteristics ideal leader facilitating knowledge transfer ethics organizations ethical knowledge implicit intangible personal difficult identify articulate posing challenge transfer knowledge structured formalized practical recommendations"

This article reports on the progress of a project that aims to develop a way in which positioning could be usefully conceptualized within public relations. It suggests a conceptual framework that takes positioning beyond the marketing definitions that have limited use in the broader public relations field. The article reports on the development of a provisional conceptual framework for intentional positioning within a public relations context. Drawing from recent developments in positioning theory in the field of psychology, a framework was developed and applied to 57 award winning public relations campaign entries. Findings reveal that the positioning framework has the potential to be applied both as an heuristic to aid analysis of practice and also as a framework to aid practitioners in designing positioning strategies.

Although Samsung wanted to express its apology through a donation, the Korean news media interpreted Samsung's philanthropic donation as an excuse or justification to minimize negative outcomes such as a tarnished reputation. The different interpretations of the donation by Samsung and the Korean news media can be attributed to the sudden change of corporate stance, influence of similar events of other companies, and socio-contextual factors (i.e., media types and affiliation).","sociocontextual influences korean news medias interpretation samsungs million donation content analyzing multinational companys philanthropic activities series illegal issues framework contingency conflict management shoemaker reeses onion media message production process crisis communication shows failure fulfill legal responsibility satisfy important public mass media case though company tries fulfill philanthropic responsibility crisis communication strategy samsung wanted express apology donation korean news media interpreted samsungs philanthropic donation excuse justification minimize negative outcomes tarnished reputation interpretations donation samsung korean news media attributed sudden change corporate stance influence similar events companies sociocontextual factors e media affiliation"

"9",2011,"academic_research","academic","Public Engagement in Supportive Communication Behaviors toward an Organization: Effects of Relational Satisfaction and Organizational Reputation in Public Relations Management Over the years, the understanding of the link between organization–public relationships and reputation constructs and their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes has advanced considerably. The Excellence Study (L. Grunig, J. Grunig, & Dozier, 2002) suggested that positive relationships built and maintained between organizations and publics can encourage publics to engage in supportive behaviors toward organizations. In support of this argument, Ki and Hon (2007b) empirically demonstrated the link between organization–public relationships and a public's supportive attitude and behavioral intentions toward an organization. Their findings show that among the four relationship indicators—control mutuality, trust, satisfaction, and commitment—relational satisfaction a public has with the organization had the strongest direct impact on the public's supportive attitude and indirect effects on behavioral intentions toward the organization. From the reputation management perspective, Fombrun pointed out that reputation “produces support for the company” (Fombrun & van Riel, 2003, p. 5), and added that reputation should be fostered because it affects publics' behaviors beneficial to organizations (Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun & van Riel, 2003). Empirical findings from recent studies support this view. Sung and Yang (2008) found that the reputation of a university perceived by its students had significant influence on their supportive attitudes toward the university. Also, in the context of country reputation, Yang, Shin, Lee and Wrigley (2008) found that the reputation of Korea perceived by foreigners had a strong effect on their supportive intentions toward Korea. As an extension to this line of research, the current study proposes to examine the effects of both relational satisfaction—a critical dimension of organization–public relationships—and organizational reputation on customers' supportive behaviors toward an organization, especially communication behaviors such as engagement in positive word-of-mouth communication and use of organizational media. Furthermore, this study aims to examine the critical mediation role of customers' identification with a company in the effects of relational satisfaction and organizational reputation on supportive communication behaviors.","public engagement supportive communication behaviors organization effects relational satisfaction organizational reputation management years link organizationpublic relationships reputation constructs attitudinal behavioral outcomes advanced considerably excellence l grunig j grunig dozier suggested positive relationships built maintained organizations publics encourage publics engage supportive behaviors organizations support argument ki hon empirically demonstrated link organizationpublic relationships publics supportive attitude behavioral intentions organization relationship indicatorscontrol mutuality trust satisfaction commitmentrelational satisfaction public organization strongest direct impact publics supportive attitude indirect effects behavioral intentions organization reputation management perspective fombrun pointed reputation produces support company fombrun van riel p added reputation fostered affects publics behaviors beneficial organizations fombrun fombrun van riel empirical recent support view sung yang reputation university perceived students influence supportive attitudes university context country reputation yang shin lee wrigley reputation korea perceived foreigners strong effect supportive intentions korea extension line current proposes effects relational satisfaction critical dimension organizationpublic relationships organizational reputation customers supportive behaviors organization especially communication behaviors engagement positive wordmouth communication use organizational media furthermore aims critical mediation role customers identification company effects relational satisfaction organizational reputation supportive communication behaviors"

The study found that when a company is well-known to consumers as Motorola and Kellogg used in this study, a CSR strategy is more effective in influencing both consumer corporate ability (CAb) and CSR associations and in turn, company/product evaluations. Additionally, consumers tend to automatically assume a company is good at making reliable products when they associate the company with strong CSR, indicating transferring effects of CSR associations onto CAb associations, and onto company/product evaluations. The study results also suggest that the direct influences of CSR associations differ based on industry type. A company that produces high risk involved products such as Motorola, might not experience as strong CSR associations' effects on consumer responses as a company in other industry type like Kellogg.","transferring effects csr strategy consumer responses synergistic corporate communication strategy proposes synergistic corporate communication strategy corporate ability strategy corporate social responsibility strategy hybrid strategy consumer responses tests using fortune companies kellogg motorola company known consumers motorola kellogg used csr strategy effective influencing consumer corporate ability cab csr associations turn companyproduct evaluations additionally consumers tend automatically assume company good making reliable products associate company strong csr indicating transferring effects csr associations onto cab associations onto companyproduct evaluations direct influences csr associations differ industry company produces high risk involved products motorola might experience strong csr associations effects consumer responses company industry like kellogg"

However, employees' communication behavior (ECB) has not been extensively researched in public relations. The purpose of this research was to conceptualize and develop concrete measurements of ECB that can help theoretical development and strategic planning in public relations. In particular, the study identified two unique aspects of ECB—megaphoning and scouting—that refer to employees' voluntary efforts to collect and circulate strategic information externally and internally. In addition, a new concept, microboundary spanning, based on the two aspects of ECB is conceptualized. In this study, symmetrical internal communication and employee-organization relationships were posited as antecedent variables to the proposed ECB variables. A survey research was conducted with 300 employees in different types of organizations in Korea.","strategic thinking employee communication behavior ecb testing models megaphoning scouting effects korea employees regarded important strategic constituencies interact external publics daily basis employees communication behavior ecb extensively researched purpose conceptualize develop concrete measurements ecb help development strategic planning particular identified unique aspects ecbmegaphoning scouting refer employees voluntary efforts collect circulate strategic information externally internally addition new concept microboundary spanning aspects ecb conceptualized symmetrical internal communication employeeorganization relationships posited antecedent variables proposed ecb variables survey conducted employees organizations korea"

Our starting point for a broader discussion on ‘race’ 1 in/and public relations (PR) is that, despite its virtual invisibility in the scholarly literature, race is firmly embedded in the context and practice of PR. Although scholars are slowly beginning to engage with race (e.g., Edwards, 2010b; Pompper, 2005; 2010; Waymer, 2010), PR scholarship has not yet paid sufficient attention to the ‘raced’ nature of the field. The dominant, functional perspectives of PR concentrate primarily on organizational goals, apparently oblivious to the impact that such goals have in relation to issues of race. On the other hand, critical approaches look at PR as a social and cultural phenomenon but these too, by and large, bypass race as an inherent part of the social and cultural domain. This special issue received many manuscripts, all encouraging in their attempts to address race. However, as we considered each one, we realized that we were perhaps more radical than most in our understanding of race. We, therefore, begin here by defining our understanding of race and explaining its relevance to public relations, to lay the groundwork for the development of ideas about how to study race in/and public relations as we move forward.","race start go starting point broader discussion race pr despite virtual invisibility scholarly race firmly embedded context practice pr scholars slowly beginning engage race eg edwards pompper waymer pr scholarship yet paid sufficient attention raced nature field dominant functional perspectives pr concentrate primarily organizational goals apparently oblivious impact goals relation issues race hand critical look pr social cultural phenomenon large bypass race inherent social cultural domain special issue received manuscripts encouraging attempts address race considered realized perhaps radical race therefore begin defining race explaining relevance lay groundwork development ideas race move forward"

After a brief survey of recent race-concerned interventions in the literature, I contend that the mainstream field still tends to avoid anxieties around race in 3 main ways: by considering race from a functionalist business orientation rather than a social equity perspective; by embedding, or freezing, race in relatively static, quantitative, and unemotional conceptualizations of culture and ethnicity; and by acting as if race is no longer an issue in a multicultural, or postrace society. I find these approaches inadequate to the task of comprehending a swift-moving and unsettled present characterized by massive population movements. To improve the field's engagement with the cultural and demographic fluidity of contemporary conditions, especially in relation to race, I open up possibilities for public relations by drawing from Bauman's concept of liquid society and his methodological creativity.","desolidifying culture bauman liquid race concerns race seeks reframe work zygmunt bauman brief survey recent raceconcerned interventions contend mainstream field tends avoid anxieties around race main ways considering race functionalist business orientation social equity perspective embedding freezing race relatively static quantitative unemotional conceptualizations culture ethnicity acting race longer issue multicultural postrace society find inadequate task comprehending swiftmoving unsettled present characterized massive population movements improve fields engagement cultural demographic fluidity contemporary conditions especially relation race open possibilities drawing baumans concept liquid society methodological creativity"

By using individuals’ cognitive perceptions of government and participation in social organizations, as well as media use and demographic characteristics, as public segmentation criteria, a cluster analysis of international survey datasets of the United States and 19 European countries generated 3 public segments in each country. The largest cluster, named the underserved inactive majority, and representing a low level of income and education, low interest in politics, low trust in others, low citizenship standards, and minimal social participation, contrasted with the smallest cluster, named the satisfied active public. The identified segments differed in trust in governmental institutions, which is a key indicator of the quality of government–public relationships. Overall, the underserved inactive majority reported the lowest trust in governmental institutions, whereas citizen trust among the satisfied active public was the highest. This study highlights the theoretical and practical values of broad-based public segmentation in government public relations from the relationship-building perspective of public relations, rather than from a problem-solving perspective.

During a year-long investigation spanning the 2008–2009 season, we conducted extensive participant observation among fans, interviews with a variety of sources (including club officials, journalists, and fans), and fan Web-site monitoring to understand the broader implications of Lerner's takeover. A consistently recurring theme during initial data analysis was the role of public relations in creating positive perceptions of Lerner as an owner. This ran contrary to the experiences of his American counterparts at other clubs. The British press, as well as academic researchers of sport globalization, has warned against the loss of localized rituals and institutions in the wake of the “foreign invasion” (Osborne & Coombs, 2009). Critics fear that foreign ownership of culturally rooted institutions such as English football clubs will create schisms between supporters’ fan identities and their national or local identities. This article uses AVFC to examine the real-world context for two public relations theories—relationship management and excellence theory—to demonstrate that well-managed public relations may allow fans to maintain their commitment to their club while embracing globalization.","case aston villa football club purchase aston villa football club avfc randy lerner joined growing ranks foreign americanowners barclays premier league yearlong investigation spanning season conducted extensive participant observation fans interviews variety sources club officials journalists fans fan website monitoring broader lerners takeover consistently recurring theme initial data role creating positive perceptions lerner owner ran contrary experiences american counterparts clubs british press academic researchers sport globalization warned loss localized rituals institutions wake foreign invasion osborne coombs critics fear foreign ownership culturally rooted institutions english football clubs create schisms supporters fan identities national local identities uses avfc realworld context relationship management excellence demonstrate managed allow fans maintain commitment club embracing globalization"

The Integrated Crisis Mapping (ICM) model is based on a publics-based, emotion-driven perspective where the publics' responses to different crises are mapped on 2 continua, the organization's engagement in the crisis and primary publics' coping strategy. This multistage testing found evidence that anxiety was the default emotion that publics felt in crises. The subsequent emotions felt by the publics varied in different quadrants involving different crisis types. As far as coping strategies were concerned, conative coping was more evident than cognitive coping across the 4 quadrants. Evidence also suggested strong merit that conative coping was the external manifestation of the internal cognitive processing that had taken place. Cognitive coping was thus the antecedent of conative coping. Although both the publics and the organizations agreed that the crises were relevant to the organizations' goals, they differed on who should assume more responsibility. The findings, although still very much exploratory, suggest theoretical rigor in the model, with room for further refinements to generate what Yin (2003) termed “analytic generalization” (p. 33) for the ICM model.","publicsdriven emotion conceptualization crisis communication unearthing dominant emotions multistaged testing integrated crisis mapping icm better minds hearts publics developed systemic responses audiences crisis situations integrated crisis mapping icm publics emotiondriven perspective publics responses crises mapped continua organizations engagement crisis primary publics coping strategy multistage testing evidence anxiety default emotion publics felt crises subsequent emotions felt publics varied quadrants involving crisis far coping strategies concerned conative coping evident cognitive coping quadrants evidence suggested strong merit conative coping external manifestation internal cognitive processing taken place cognitive coping thus antecedent conative coping publics organizations agreed crises relevant organizations goals differed assume responsibility much exploratory rigor room refinements generate yin termed analytic generalization p icm"

A recent series of experimental studies supports the idea that the theory is also applicable in the public's estimation pattern regarding an organization's public relations practices. This survey study is theoretically important when examining and sorting out significant factors in the real population of a notable public diplomacy domain. That is, this research examines how the South Korean people perceive the contingency factors and how people estimate the South Korean government's stance toward its opposing public, North Korea. The regression model of perceived contingency factors and stance estimation was generalizable in the population of this study (R 2 = .279). The most influential perceptual predictors in the model include: the North Korean leader's preference for the South Korean president, the relative power of South Korea, the level of commitment of North Korea, the South Korean president's preference for the North Korean leader, the US government's support for the South Korean policy toward North Korea, the South Korean government's certainty to deal with the North Korean military threat, situational difficulties, the South Korean government's knowledge and skill to deal with the threat, the situational duration of threat, and the South Korean president's relation-oriented leadership.

Our results indicated that in a laptop product category crisis, participants perceived target audiences to be more influenced than themselves when locus of control was internal rather than when it was external. This study delved into the potential effect on target groups and the corporation resulting from possible exaggerated perceptions of the impact of the crisis on the target groups. This perception may prompt or even pressure target audiences to react more strongly in keeping with the perceived impact, not their actual concern with the crisis.

His assumption was that organizational public relations too often depend not on established or enduring standards of effectiveness, but on the presumptions of public relations executives and the senior managers who are in charge at any given time. Frequently, when one managerial regime leaves the entity and is replaced by another, within a short period of time the public relations program looks entirely different than before the change. Grunig cited research by Yi, which indicated that any institutionalization of public relations that may currently exist is that of buffering organizations against outside pressures, rather than the more essential bridging or linkage activities that, in the long run, make organizations more successful. This article, then, represents an exploratory qualitative examination of 6 organizations where there was a turnover of senior public relations executives. The study determines whether the public relations programs changed after the turnover—and, if so, why the changes occurred.

The call for papers for this special issue on nonprofit organizations and public relations generated an overwhelming response, yielding the largest number of submissions for a special issue in recent history. I hope that the issue will stimulate more research in this important area. The articles in this issue explore new areas of research for nonprofit communication and answer interesting questions about how media impact nonprofits, how organizational support develops, how nonprofits should use online resources, and how nonprofit organizations manage conflict between staff and volunteers. The issue opens with an overview of the current state of nonprofit public relations research, and this sets the stage for the remaining articles that build theory around nonprofit communication. This issue addresses a broad range of theories, including situational theory of publics, agenda setting, impression management, theory of reasoned action, and conflict management. Combined, they offer an array of approaches to nonprofit communication. They cover critical areas for nonprofit organizations, including fundraising, volunteerism, mobilizing resources in an online environment, and encouraging advocacy. Some of the authors in this issue appear on the list of top contributors to nonprofit public relations research (see Fussell et al., this issue) and some are up-and-coming scholars in the field.

Although this folklore is commonly believed by many fundraisers, there is little evidence to support this claim. This study uses the agenda-setting theory as the framework to test whether television news coverage of 3 natural disasters and the nonprofit organizations working to provide charitable relief in wake of the events results in increased donations to the nonprofit organizations. Using the 2004 Asian tsunami, 2005's Hurricane Katrina, and the 2010 Haitian earthquake to test the public's response to relief efforts, the study found little support for increased donations to the 5 leading organizations providing relief in relation to generic news coverage of the disasters. However, when the organizations were specifically mentioned by reporters in the newscasts, noticeable same-day spikes were seen in donations to the organizations’ fundraising efforts. Similarly, when organizations were able to place spokespeople in the newscast to talk about their efforts, increased donations resulted from these proactive media relations efforts.","tracing impact media relations television coverage us charitable relief fundraising application agendasetting natural disasters fundraising practitioners expressed desire gain media coverage nonprofit organization result increased donations folklore commonly believed fundraisers little evidence support claim uses agendasetting framework test television news coverage natural disasters nonprofit organizations working charitable relief wake events increased donations nonprofit organizations using asian tsunami hurricane katrina haitian earthquake test publics response relief efforts little support increased donations leading organizations providing relief relation generic news coverage disasters organizations mentioned reporters newscasts noticeable day spikes seen donations organizations fundraising efforts similarly organizations able place spokespeople newscast talk efforts increased donations resulted proactive media relations efforts"

This study examines how US-based practitioners are discursively framing the meaning of globalization within their own interpretive community. It analyzes all the articles on globalization that appeared in the first decade of this century in the US trade publication The PR Strategist. The main purpose of this discourse analysis was to unpack the ideological underpinnings of practitioner views to discuss the critical implications of the same for the profession. Findings indicate that although practitioners stress the need to be sensitive to issues of cultural diversity and avoid cultural imperialism in the profession, the overall interpretation of globalization is limited to a neoliberal economistic perspective, rather than geared toward genuine critique and creative alternatives.","constructing meaning globalization framing pr strategist global expansion industry widely acknowledged little evidence exists globalization means practitioners us practitioners discursively framing meaning globalization interpretive community analyzes globalization appeared decade century us trade publication pr strategist main purpose discourse unpack ideological underpinnings practitioner views discuss critical profession practitioners stress need sensitive issues cultural diversity avoid cultural imperialism profession overall interpretation globalization limited neoliberal economistic perspective geared genuine critique creative alternatives"

The model proposes that public relations practitioners' trait-level intercultural competence (empathy, open-mindedness, and flexibility) affect their perceptual-level competence (anxiety and uncertainty management), which in turn influence their behavioral-level competence (public relations practices) and the consequent relational quality with the publics. Structural equal modeling was used to analyze the data from 90 practitioners with rich intercultural public relations experiences. Results indicated that trait competence components worked differently in reducing practitioners' uncertainty and anxiety. Such distress reduction enhanced the use of symmetrical and two-way public relations. Finally, symmetrical public relations and lowered anxiety increased practitioners' perceptions of trust and control mutuality in the relationships their organizations had with the publics.

This scenario-based experimental study validates the usefulness of the CA–CSR crisis categorization by demonstrating that not only do people actually discern differences between these two types of crises, but their awareness of a crisis type also influences their interpretation of the crisis, as well as their perceptions of and attitudes toward the target firm. In particular, this study shows that a CSR crisis, versus a CA crisis, is interpreted more seriously and, consequently, causes heavier damage to the evaluation of the firm. In addition, the halo effect of a favorable prior reputation was found in the CA crisis condition, but not in the CSR condition. Based on these findings, this study suggests that the recognition of CA and CSR crises provides a boundary condition, which determines divergent effects of crises on perceivers' evaluation of the target firm.","reputational crisis definition properties consequences better nature reputational crisis crisis events using corporate ability ca corporate social responsibility csr crisis categorization frameworks scenario experimental validates usefulness cacsr crisis categorization demonstrating people actually discern differences crises awareness crisis influences interpretation crisis perceptions attitudes target firm particular shows csr crisis versus ca crisis interpreted seriously consequently causes heavier damage evaluation firm addition halo effect favorable prior reputation ca crisis condition csr condition recognition ca csr crises boundary condition determines divergent effects crises perceivers evaluation target firm"

In 1940, as part of a widespread propaganda campaign to assuage public concerns about industry and rehabilitate big business's reputation, NAM created and distributed the community relations short film, Your Town. The movie, pursuing an integration propaganda strategy, appealed to Americans' individualistic values by portraying industry as a beneficent fellow traveler who was a big individual—a heroic, larger-than-life figure who could make the land profitable and guard the citizenry against evil, antibusiness influences. Applying Vogler's (1997) synthesis of Campbell's (1949) heroic narrative form, this article shows that NAM's portrayal of industry as a hero has continued to resonate with strains of contemporary American thought that (a) sees business as the foundation for societal progress and stability and (b) conceptualizes the corporate entity as a person.

However, NGOs have not received much attention in research on international public relations. This study contributes to filling that gap by analyzing how NGOs manage public relations according to the generic principles of excellence in global public relations and how they coordinate strategic communication between headquarters and local units. An online survey of 440 practitioners revealed 2 excellence clusters and 4 clusters of organizations with differing degrees of centralization. Excellent NGOs were found to assign more resources to public relations and more frequently considered cultural context in their communication programs. Thus, the study gives significant insights into international public relations practice in the global civil society sector and reveals further need for modifying and extending public relations theory in that respect.","communicating behalf global civil society management coordination international nongovernmental organizations last decades nongovernmental organizations ngos become influential actors creating awareness international social political environmental economic causes global society ngos received much attention international contributes filling gap analyzing ngos manage according generic principles excellence global coordinate strategic communication headquarters local units online survey practitioners excellence clusters clusters organizations differing degrees centralization excellent ngos assign resources frequently considered cultural context communication programs thus gives insights international practice global civil society sector reveals need modifying extending respect"

The article contends that progress in public relations practice and scholarship has been inhibited by a failure to recognize or reconcile paradoxes associated with popular concepts, such as relationship management, mutually beneficial relationships, and symmetrical communication.

These credentials are, in turn, used to support claims of legitimacy for organizational operations. This article uses a process model of antecedents, implementation, and consequences to study the connection between engagement and CSR. CSR reports show organizations perceive engagement in CSR as both communication and activities between organizations and their stakeholders; and as a second, meta-level of communication about that engagement with stakeholders beyond those directly involved, thereby broadening the scope of organizational claims to legitimacy.

The validity of the CIT in the context of internal public relations depends on 3 assumptions: that participants can describe discrete communication events, that these events have structural connotations, and that they are related to sensemaking. We reviewed these assumptions with CIT data collected within 3 organizations. In this study, participants predominantly mentioned discrete events. Most events related to structural aspects of communication, and in many cases the events were linked to individual sensemaking or storytelling activities. The findings confirm the CIT's potential to assess the quality of internal communication.","evaluating internal using critical incident technique critical incident technique cit current methods communication audits little known way works validity cit context internal depends assumptions participants describe discrete communication events events structural connotations sensemaking reviewed assumptions cit data collected organizations participants predominantly mentioned discrete events events structural aspects communication cases events linked individual sensemaking storytelling activities confirm cits potential assess quality internal communication"

Implicit and Explicit Measures of the Effect of the PR Spokesman's Race on Evaluations of Spokesman Source Credibility and Perceptions of a PR Crisis' Severity One rationale offered for why there are fewer people of color in public relations is that publics would respond less positively if racial minorities represented the public face of an organization. To determine the plausibility of this rationale, this study employed a 2 (race: Black vs. White spokesman) × 2 (performance history: with prior crisis vs. no prior crisis) × 2 (crisis type: sports vs. product recall) within-subjects experiment (N = 64), using both implicit (reaction time) and explicit (self-report) measures. Contrary to expectations, participants rated Black spokesmen as significantly more credible than White spokesmen using explicit measures. Most significantly, implicit tests, using response time measures, revealed that heuristic cues, such as the spokesman's race, have an influence on perceptions in the absence of a performance history, i.e., when no other information must be cognitively processed. But in cases where there is a crisis history, i.e., when there is more pertinent information, racial cues play less of a role.",""

This article aims to broaden the understanding of expectations by taking into account their multidimensional nature, suggesting that there are several explanations to expectations depending on what the expectation is based on. We suggest that, in organizational context, expectations are two-fold assessments of what is considered good or desirable (expectation tone ranging from positive to negative) and the confidence placed in the organization (organization-specific context ranging from high to low confidence). As a result of the conceptual review with theoretical input from areas outside the scope of public relations, the article presents the Expectation Grid, where expectations are acknowledged as continuums of tone and context.","broadening concept expectations expectations connected central concepts yet definitions meant expectations lacking aims broaden expectations taking account multidimensional nature suggesting several explanations expectations depending expectation organizational context expectations fold assessments considered good desirable expectation tone ranging positive negative confidence placed organization organization context ranging high low confidence result conceptual review input areas outside scope presents expectation grid expectations acknowledged continuums tone context"

Within the field of crisis communication, research has primarily taken an interest in the rhetorical strategies of actors when explaining successes or failures. In this article, we examine key characteristics of what we refer to as crisis exploitation coverage in the news media. We do so based on a comparative quantitative study of 3 crisis cases (terror, floods, and financial crisis) selected due to their differences in journalistic routines and preparedness. The results of the study revealed that the similarities in the cases were more pronounced than their differences.

The primary purpose of this study was to test the proposed scale for measuring organization–public dialogic communication (OPDC). Additionally, this study aimed to demonstrate the link between dialogic communication and trust/distrust between organizations studied and their publics. For the research purpose, two anonymous online surveys were used to collect the data. The participants were American consumers randomly selected from a representative research panel of online survey participants (N = 704). According to the results, the proposed 2-factor, 28-item scale of OPDC was valid and reliable.

"102",2015,"academic_research","academic","Time Marches On, and So Does the History of Public Relations This is the first, and hopefully not the last, special issue on the history of public relations in the Journal of Public Relations Research. It has been very oversubscribed in terms of submissions and a challenge to select six papers from so many entries. This problem is actually a sign of scholarly health with symptoms of a wide range of topics from numerous parts of the world. For those who are new to this field of research and scholarship, it may be a surprise that the expansion of historical research into public relations has taken off in the past 8 years. Although there had been sporadic publication of articles in journals and some important texts, notably by Hiebert (1966), Cutlip (1994, 1995), Ewen (1996), Marchand (1998), Tye (1998), Miller (1999) and Griese (2001), it was not a field that was thriving. As indicated by the nation of these authors, it appeared to be wholly based in the United States and lacked an international dimension. That was an erroneous view as scholars such as Michael Kunczik, Günter Bentele and Peter Szyszka in Germany, Karl Nessmann in Austria and Jacquie L'Etang in the United Kingdom had published articles and books from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s but with recognition limited by language and exposure in the main public relations academic journals. The expansion took place after a ‘History of public relations’ special issue in the Journal of Communication Management (2008, Vol 12, No. 4) prompted the organization of the annual International History of Public Relations Conference (IHPRC) at Bournemouth University in England from 2010 onward. This specialist conference has been the platform on which historians of public relations and academic researchers reflecting on the historical influences upon theory and practice have presented their research. Around 170 papers have been presented by authors from more than 40 countries during the first five conferences. Some of the papers submitted to this special issue arose from IHPRC 2014 presentations. In addition to conference proceedings (available at http://historyofpr.com), there has been expansion of academic publishing in book form from leading publishers such as Routledge and Palgrave Macmillan, and of journal articles. The discovery stage in which national histories have been written, personalities and influencers identified, and practices explored have provided the bulk of scholarship. At the time of writing, a series of books on National Perspectives on the Development of Public Relations covering 73 countries in all continents and regions other than North America is being published by Palgrave (Watson, 2014/2015). This includes countries of which little has been researched on the evolution of public relations (e.g., Bulgaria, Indonesia, Uganda, the nations of Central America) and those which are well-explored (Germany, United Kingdom). As this stage has continued, it has become evident that there is no single model of public relations and the concept of public relations is broadly interpreted with important cultural variations that operate alongside the internationalized practices of the agency networks and corporations. Research into archives, oral histories and documentary analysis has buttressed similar findings from studies into global practices of public relations (e.g., Sriramesh & Verčič, 2009). However, the scholarship has moved on to more analytical and critical approaches (Watson, 2014), with increasing discourse on historiography. The emphasis, as expressed in major text books used around the world, on Great Men such as Ivy L. Lee, Edward Bernays, and Arthur W. Page and that public relations was invented in the United States is being challenged by research into formative influences on public relations (Lamme & Russell, 2010; Wakefield, 2013) and by noncorporatist perspectives (Coombs & Holladay, 2012; Somerville & Purcell, 2011). The critical approach to history has followed on from McKie and Munshi's (2007) argument that many public relations historical accounts “are unique and unchallenged, or under-challenged, and in need of pluralising with robust perspectives” (p. 119) and “align with a modernist perspective” (p. 120). The critical approach (L'Etang, 2008, 2014; Logan, 2014; McKie & Xifra 2014) has refreshed understanding of public relations by contextualizing it within social and organizational frames, and the pressures and influences that shape communication. Previously it had often been presented as a stand-alone practice with professional ambitions that existed outside organizational, social, political and economic contexts. The six articles that follow in this special issue extend the historiographical debate (Jordi Xifra and Robert L. Heath), consider the emergence of public relations within the Franco dictatorship of mid-century Spain (Natalia Rodriguez-Salcedo), introduce Peitho, the Greek goddess of persuasion (Charles Marsh), explore the role of public relations in the communications efforts of the French Resistance in World War II (Gareth Thompson), place Chinese public relations within the modernization of that country (Baijing Hu, Christine Yi Hui Huang, and Di Zhang), and review the rejection by U.S. religious communicators to public relations as a concept and operational term (Douglas F. Cannon). They are a rich tapestry of historical research that widen our understanding of public relations as being much more than the management of communications in a corporate mould. To choose six from 28 submissions has been very difficult, and as guest editor, I am most grateful for the 60 or so reviewers who have given their time, knowledge, and academic scrutiny to all the articles. They, and all the authors, have contributed to the continuing expansion of the history of public relations.",""

Energy for that effort is being generated by recent discussions of propaganda and reputation in Assyriology. Major archeological findings of the 2nd half of the twentieth century revealed texts explicating a system of public communication, the purpose of which was to legitimize the power of monarchs in the ancient Near East. Founded on written (royal inscriptions) and iconographic materials and influenced by the historical materialism predominant in historiography when Assyriology was at its height, Assyriologists have approached the study of Mesopotamian state ideology via an essentially communicative dimension where the search for legitimacy and hegemony is articulated through communication in the form of impression and reputation management. To that end, Gramsci's state theory, in particular his conception of historical blocs—dominant configurations of material capabilities, ideologies and institutions as determining frames for individual and collective action—are deemed useful for a critical view of public relations historiography.","reputation propaganda hegemony assyriology gramscian view historiography aim revisit robust interest history role behalf organizations communities energy effort generated recent discussions propaganda reputation assyriology major archeological half twentieth century texts explicating system public communication purpose legitimize power monarchs ancient near east founded written royal inscriptions iconographic materials influenced historical materialism predominant historiography assyriology height assyriologists approached mesopotamian state ideology via essentially communicative dimension search legitimacy hegemony articulated communication form impression reputation management end gramscis state particular conception historical blocsdominant configurations material capabilities ideologies institutions determining frames individual collective action deemed useful critical view historiography"

Findings, based on 19 interviews with key decision-makers in 16 companies from the Standard & Poor India ESG Index, revealed that practitioners in India foregrounded the importance of an implicit, minimalist approach to communication that privileged responsible corporate behavior over rhetoric. They also engaged in the strategic communication of their CSR efforts to involved stakeholders, largely avoiding publicity and aggressive media relations. Implications for public relations theory and practice are discussed.","paradox communicating csr india minimalist strategic viewpoints practitioners socially responsible companies india ethical dilemmas corporate social responsibility csr communication especially paradoxical context stakeholders high regard socially responsible companies low regard companies deliberate conspicuous communication csr interviews decisionmakers companies standard poor india esg index practitioners india foregrounded importance implicit minimalist communication privileged responsible corporate behavior rhetoric engaged strategic communication csr efforts involved stakeholders largely avoiding publicity aggressive media relations practice"

A cross-cultural survey of senior managers highlights the uniqueness of Indonesia by comparing practitioners’ perceptions with results from two Western countries, namely Austria and Australia. The results reveal the limitations of traditional professionalization theories; embedding corporate communication into the cultural and institutional context has proved to be more instructive. Practitioners in Indonesia employ a comparably critical distance to their own cultural environment. However, at the same time, they are highly adaptive when it comes to the stringently regulated and politicized institutional context of their work. From a normative perspective, we would instead support a self-understanding of professional communicators as societal change agents.","beyond professional snail races contextualizing corporate communication indonesia overview current state corporate communication indonesias largest companies crosscultural survey senior managers highlights uniqueness indonesia comparing practitioners perceptions western countries namely austria australia reveal limitations traditional professionalization embedding corporate communication cultural institutional context proved instructive practitioners indonesia employ comparably critical distance cultural environment time highly adaptive comes stringently regulated politicized institutional context work normative perspective instead support self professional communicators societal change agents"
"122",2016,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay Since taking on the work of editing this journal in January 2015, I have become increasingly reflective regarding the myriad challenges facing public relations scholarship—and, indeed, these same challenges threaten scholarly activity in any discipline. In particular, I have been thinking a lot about Campbell’s Law (1979/2011), which states that “The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor” (2011, p. 34). Let’s consider Campbell’s Law in the context of academic research and publication: We all know that tenure and promotion at universities—no matter what kind of universities—increasingly is contingent on scholarly activity. Whether the standard is publishing five peer-reviewed articles per year or five such articles over the span of one’s tenure-earning timeframe or clock, the pressure felt by authors is real. “Publish or perish”—long an adage in the academy—has become a nuclear arms race in which publications are stockpiled onto CVs but seldom used (i.e., read), except perhaps by other authors building the literature review portions of their own manuscripts that they, in turn, seek to publish. This is a problem. Obvi. At least, it’s a problem if we care about being a true community of scholars, as opposed to an army of article producers. Excellent thought- and research-provoking scholarship used to generate citations precisely because of their heuristic value, their ability to generate reflection, dialog, debate, and subsequent scholarship. Now, the generating of citations seems to be an end unto itself, with some authors promoting their new publications via social media and, in some cases, outright asking others to cite them. We in public relations, of all disciplines, should know that the line is fine between informing the public and promoting the self (whether individual or organizational) and that the micro- and meso-level interests of individuals and organizations must be balanced against the macro-level interests of society and community. I have no solutions to this problem. And perhaps the only possible solutions are ones that individual scholars find for and within themselves, balancing their professional aspirations in the game of tenure and promotion with their personal willingness to play that game, to the extent necessary at their institutions. For and in the community of public relations scholars, I can only do my best to stay true to the primary purpose of this journal, which is to create, test, refine or expand public relations theory. Inside this issue I still believe in the heuristic value of theoretically grounded and methodologically sound research, as well as in the ability of such articles to generate their own citations. But, just in case, let me facilitate those citations by summarizing here the value of each article for our public relations scholarly community. (I won’t, however, promote the articles on social media; one has to draw a line somewhere!) Effects of crisis efficacy on intentions to follow directives during crisis This article by Elizabeth Avery and Sejin Park is both theoretically and pragmatically significant. First, the authors propose a new theoretical construct of crisis efficacy, not only explicating how this term differs conceptually from both self-efficacy and response efficacy, but also testing those distinctions, with statistically significant results. Their finding that crisis efficacy predicts willingness to follow directives in crisis situations enhances our understanding of the “cognitive mechanisms underlying audience processing of crisis instructing information” (p. 72). The study is valuable because it focuses on an oft-neglected piece of reality in crisis management research: that the consequences of crises extend beyond damage to an organization to very real people, be they consumers, residents or other stakeholders. Furthermore, this article brings scholarly attention to the least-studied stage of crisis management (the pre-crisis), while offering practical value for practitioners trying to design instructive messages for the public to use during crises. The value of public relations: Different impacts of communal and exchange relationships on perceptions and communicative behavior While Avery and Park investigate how cognitions and attitudes affect behaviors during a crisis, Jarim Kim and Minjung Sung examine the impact of organization–public relationships on cognitions and attitudes, as well as—ultimately—on communicative behaviors. Grounded in the situational theory of publics (Grunig, 1997) and its successor theory, the situational theory of problem solving (Kim & Grunig, 2011), this article probes the differential impacts of exchange versus communal relationships. Theoretically, this study is valuable because it further opens up the black box of processes by which publics become activists, including motivation and political inclination as additional considerations. Methodologically, the study is useful in reminding us that student samples remain appropriate primarily when the research purpose is to generalize to student populations. Pragmatically, this research is instructive in statistically demonstrating the value of communal relationships over exchange relationships, which may encourage organizations to invest the time and resources necessary to develop the former. Effects of attributed responsibility and response strategies on organizational reputation: A meta-analysis of situational crisis communication theory research Liang Ma and Mengqi (Monica) Zhan offer value to public relations scholars by presenting results of a meta-analysis of research on how organizational reputation is affected by both attributed responsibility and crisis response strategies. Driven largely by Coombs’ (1995, 2007) popular situational crisis communication theory (SCCT), this area of scholarship generally has offered two propositions: first, that public attribution of crisis responsibility affects organizational reputation; and second, that organizational crisis-response strategies should match the level of responsibility attributed by publics to organizations for their crises. Underscoring the theoretical value of SCCT, Liang and Zhan’s meta-analysis found support for both propositions, albeit in differing strengths: “Although attributed responsibility posed severe threat to organizational reputation, responding to a crisis according to attributed responsibility was not enough to protect reputation” (p. 113). From a methodological standpoint, this article is helpful to scholars in reminding us that a proper meta-analysis includes actual statistical analysis, i.e., meta-analysis is not merely a discussion of a collection of results from myriad scholarly works. Also, this study offers three key considerations for public relations researchers studying public response to crises. First, studies of organizational reputation must define this concept more clearly and operationalize it more carefully, distinguishing credibility from general favorability. Second, student samples do not reflect the heterogeneity of nonstudent populations and thus should be used only when studying populations of actual students, as Sung and Kim do in this issue. Finally, it may not matter whether real or fictitious crisis scenarios are used for research purposes. W. Timothy Coombs responds In the increasingly high-stakes, pressure-cooker world of academia, we may forget that the purpose of scholarly production is not merely to produce still-more research, enhance academic reputations, or gain citations of our work. Rather, a fundamental purpose of scholarly production is to offer researchers the opportunity to engage in critical thinking, scholarly reflection, and collegial dialogue. Thus, in an effort to facilitate the latter, I invited W. Timothy Coombs to reflect on the meta-analysis of SCCT research, with the manuscript’s authorship blinded to him. He was kind enough to engage in this effort, and consequently his invited article is the final piece in this issue of the Journal.","editors essay since taking work editing journal january become

"127",2016,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay Editing an academic journal is fraught with challenges, not least of which is helping authors to separate myth from reality. To that end, I would like to address here the myth that the Journal does not publish qualitative research. In short, this is complete and utter nonsense. Even a casual perusal of scholarship published in Journal of Public Relations Research since its inception shows that authors of both quantitative and qualitative research have been given a voice in these pages. Like any other editor who cares about citation indices and journal rankings (read: like every other editor), I want to publish the absolute best scholarship. Period. And by “best scholarship,” I mean research that is held to the highest standards for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. In quantitative research, the typical standards are internal and external validity, as well as reliability and replicability. Here are some ways in which those standards might “translate” for evaluating qualitative research: For details on each of these standards, please review the work of the authors cited. Or what the heck, use Google. To make these conceptual standards more concrete, let me offer here some specific questions for scholars planning to submit qualitative research to the Journal: Who are you? Reflexivity is an important component to qualitative scholarship because the researcher is “the instrument” in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. Thus, readers need to know more about you, your possible implicit biases in the treatment of data, and how you strived to mitigate those inherent biases. This effort is akin to our expectation that authors of survey-based manuscripts report the source(s) of their instrument items. What is your point? The primary purpose of this journal is to create, test, refine or expand public relations theory. You need to synthesize and interpret the data, connect it back to your theoretical framework, and articulate how the results of your qualitative research effort meet the purpose of this journal. If the results are merely descriptive of some phenomenon without an articulation of why that affects our understanding of public relations theory, then your manuscript needs some more work. Would we accept a manuscript from a quantitative scholar who merely submitted her/his SPSS data file as the “results” section? Of course not. But this is essentially what some qualitative scholars do when their manuscripts only present a bunch of raw quotes from various research participants, without contextualization, synthesis or interpretation. What drove your research choices? You did participant observation in Country X; explain why this country was appropriate for your research purpose. For example, was this the first or most recent country to experience the specific public relations phenomenon under study? Or did you just need a tax-deductible reason to visit Country X for summer break, so you did some “data collection” while there? You interviewed 25 people; explain why you stopped at this number. Was data saturation reached? Or did you run out of time or money? You did a focus group with practitioners from your region; explain why those specific participants had the expertise to help answer your research questions. For example, if you are studying social media use, are the managers in the focus group actually the ones with expertise executing those tactics? If you’re studying crisis response, did your interviewees actually have work experience managing organizational crises? Or did you just talk to your own practitioner friends and their acquaintances as your “snowball sample”? Having offered what I hope are helpful tips, let me now provide brief summaries of the quantitative and qualitative research given voice in this double issue. Development and test of a multidimensional scale of blog engagement In addition to proposing a (much-needed) three-item correlated model for blog engagement, the article by Toby Hopp and Tiffany Derville Gallicano offers readers helpful transparency regarding the procedures undertaken to develop the scale. Specifically, these researchers grounded their quantitative work for scale development in themes that had emerged from prior qualitative scholarship, thus illustrating one way in which qualitative research has the potential to inform quantitative research. The researchers also break new ground in their conceptualization of “social media engagement” as a multi-dimensional construct that encompasses utility, presence, virality, and personal connection. In doing so, they are careful to offer “blog engagement” (using only the dimensions of utility, presence, and virality) as one contextual application of “social media engagement,” rather than equating one construct to the other. This definition also enables public relations scholars to move forward from superficially discussing “social media engagement” when they are merely examining “online interactions.” Organizational listening: Addressing a major gap in public relations theory and practice The article by Jim Macnamara extends the concept of “listening” more systematically into public relations theory and practice. To begin, the author thoroughly documents the lack of serious theorizing by public relations scholars regarding the concept of listening and in that process distills five essential elements of public relations: Two-way communication, relationships, dialogue, engagement, and co-orientation. The study offers a good example of the value of qualitative research, not as a precursor to quantitative efforts, but as inherently valuable when undertaken using a naturalistic interpretive approach. The mention (on p. 154) of standards by which qualitative research can be evaluated may be particularly helpful to novice researchers. Specifically, the article demonstrates confirmability by offering a careful explanation of the author’s qualitative research sampling. The study’s multiple methods of data collection (i.e., in-depth interviews, document analysis and field experiments) enhance the credibility of the research. A message-focused measurement of the communication dimension of social capital: Revealing shared meaning in a network of relationships Adam J. Saffer offers a complex manuscript that carefully integrates social capital theory and symbolic convergence theory by focusing on the concepts of shared meaning and networks, all summarized neatly in a conceptual process model. This article lays a foundation for theory building in public relations in several ways. First, the conceptualization straddles a (mis?)perceived disciplinary divide between the “rhetorical” and “management/systems” approaches to public relations theory (see Toth & Heath, 1992). Scholars from an earlier generation may have grounded their work on their respective traditions of speech communication or mass communication, but I believe we have been seeing a transition to integrated scholarship drawing on the strengths of both traditions, which this article demonstrates. Secondly, and reflective of that scholarly integration, Saffer offers both a network analysis and a fantasy theme analysis, using data collected from multiple texts, qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey. This triangulation of methods sheds light on both networked social capital and shared social reality as organizational resources, and the manuscript demonstrates great thoroughness in explaining how data were collected and analyzed. Finally, the results of this study remind us that, no matter how effective public relations efforts may be in creating messages on behalf of organizations, organizational stakeholders will always create — over time, using multiple communication channels, across myriad contexts — their own shared meanings of those messages. Nonprofit relationship management: Extending the organization-public relationship to loyalty and behaviors Geah Nicole Pressgrove and Brooke Weberling McKeever advance the study of organization-public relationships by treating Hon and Grunig’s (1999) measures of trust, commitment and satisfaction not as relational outcomes, but as predictors of loyalty and behavioral intentions. They thus extend public relations theory by offering the concept of “loyalty” as an outcome of relationship maintenance strategies in public relations, admitting that this concept needs better measurement even as they offer a careful overview of prior research on loyalty and note its distinction from “commitment.” Conceptually, the authors review the dimensions of stewardship (responsibility, reporting, relationship-nurturing, and reciprocity), finding evidence that the latter dimension may in fact be a composite of private/personal regard and public recognition. Furthermore, the authors examine the extent to which that five-dimensional scale for measuring stewardship (see Pressgrove, 2016) has predictive validity for dimensions of organization-public relationships, considering whether different types of stakeholder groups are differentially affected. The study reported here poses many directions for research, not least because the high levels of multicollinearity suggest that the examined variables may in fact be dimensions of a single meta-concept, rather than reflective of independent concepts on their own. For example, what really is the difference – conceptual and operational – between “commitment” and “loyalty”? Only future research will tell.","editors essay editing academic journal fraught challenges least helping separate myth reality end like address myth journal publish qualitative short complete utter

"132",2016,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay The world is full of divisions, various ways in which people set themselves apart from “Others” that are perceived—correctly or incorrectly—to be different. For example, we see in society divisions between the so-called progressives and conservatives, rural and urban areas, the rich and the poor, and the more educated and the less educated. Among the more educated, in the academy, we see divisions between the so-called hard sciences and social sciences, between more established disciplines (like sociology) and relative newcomers (like media studies). In any discipline (including public relations), we see divisions between scholars and practitioners, between academics from teaching colleges and those from research universities, and between researchers from one scholarly tradition and those from another. Perhaps the latter division is one reason we have a double-blind peer-review process for academic journals like this one. As more seasoned scholars know, double-blind means manuscript reviewers are blind to the identities of manuscript authors, and manuscript authors are blind to the identities of reviewers.1 On the plus side, the double-blind process of peer review means that, theoretically, reviewers can more objectively (or—at least—less subjectively) evaluate the quality of research under consideration for publication in this journal. On the minus side, no amount of authorship-blinding, reviewer training, or hand-wringing will ever fully eliminate bias in the review process. Why? Because each and every one of us holds implicit biases that affect how we see the world, whether or not we recognize their influences or impacts. Implicit bias Implicit bias is defined as the “attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner” (Staats, Capatosto, Wright, & Jackson, 2016, p. 14). Implicit bias is about social cognition, and it is “activated involuntarily, without awareness or intentional control. [It] can be either positive or negative. Everyone is susceptible” (p. 14). Implicit bias is endemic to society, and it is not just about race, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation. Implicit bias can also be about body size, weight, beauty, dialect, skin tone, physical ability, mental ability and health, marital status, even what time of day an employee shows up to the office. In one form or another, implicit bias has been found to affect supervisor evaluations of employees (Yam, Fehr, Barnes, Kozlowski, & Chen, 2014), treatment of patients by doctors and other health care providers (Chapman, Kaatz, & Carnes, 2013; John-Henderson, 2015; Zestcott, Blair, & Stone, 2016), police officers’ use of force on the job (Fridell & Lim, 2016), recruitment and hiring of job candidates (Cocchiara, Bell, & Casper, 2016; Nadler, Lowery, Grebinoski, Jones, & Gonsiorek, 2014), decisions about receivers of charitable microfinance lending (Jenq, Pan, & Theseira, 2015), graduate school admissions (Strunk & Bailey, 2015), disciplinary referrals of students (Girvan, Gion, Mcintosh, & Smolkowski, 2016) … the list goes on. Why we should care As public relations scholars, students, and practitioners, why should we care about implicit bias? I think we should care least of all that implicit bias affects the process of journal reviews, which, after all, has a relative safeguard in the double-blind peer-review process. Rather, we should consider that implicit bias affects the kind of research we choose to conduct and how we choose to conduct it. Why do we put our collective intellectual capacity behind the investigation of some issues and not others? Are the topics we study truly worthy of our intellect, our time, and our energy? And we should care more that implicit bias affects how we teach our students and advise our clients. Do we inadvertently disrespect those who need us, for their very need of our expertise? Are we so centered on ourselves that we forget to consider the impact of our words and our actions on those who are not like us? How do our implicit biases affect the grades we give and the employees we hire? Finally, I think we should especially care that the implicit bias of public relations practitioners affects how organizations build relationships with stakeholders, starting with the very decision of which stakeholders are “worth” building relationships with. Because at the end of the day, implicit bias is an unconscious judgment about value—who has it, and who does not. What we can do The scholarly literature across various disciplines is rife with examples of the real-world impacts of implicit bias, as well as with numerous studies suggesting ways in which implicit bias might be acknowledged, minimized, and mitigated (at least in its effects). I challenge each of us to reflect on our own implicit biases and to reach out to those who may be different from ourselves. Explain public relations to a colleague from biology or engineering; share what professors do at work with a neighbor who didn’t get the chance to attend college; or ask a public relations practitioner what drives her decisions on the job (because we know it’s probably not theory). Only by building bridges (and not walls) can we begin to overcome what divides us, one of those dividers being our own implicit biases toward others. Communicated commitment and conversational voice: Abbreviated measures of communicative strategies for maintaining organization-public relationships Kaye D. Sweetser and Tom Kelleher examine strategies that organizations can use to maintain relationships with their publics. Prior studies have shown that strategies for the maintenance of organization-public relationships (OPRs) include relational commitment, responsiveness/openness, human or conversational voice, positivity, and task sharing. Sweetser and Kelleher advance our scholarly understanding of OPR-maintenance strategies in two ways. First, the authors acknowledge the digital media context for all current efforts to maintain OPRs, and they incorporate that context into their research question for the study. Second, they use a rigorous, 3-phase process to reduce a measure of OPR-maintenance strategies from 25 items to an 11-item scale composed of two factors: Communicated commitment and conversational voice. The resultant tool has strong potential for advancing theory-building in public relations by enabling the collection of data from organizations that may have found the original 25-item measurement too long and cumbersome to use. We cannot move theory forward without data, and we cannot collect data when participants opt out of research due to lack of time or interest. Thus, the reduced 11-item scale developed by Sweetser and Kelleher serves public relations researchers across the academic-pragmatic divide. Why practitioners do (not) apply crisis communication theory in practice Although Sweetser and Kelleher (2016) offer an abbreviated measurement tool to facilitate better research by both academics and practitioners on the strategies to maintain organization-public relationships, An-Sofie Claeys and Michaël Opgenhaffen note that, often, “practically relevant research is not undertaken by academics” (2016, p. 233). Indeed, “there is nothing so practical as a good theory” (Lewin, 1951, p. 169). Yet, both anecdotal evidence and scholarly research tell us that public relations practitioners do not always follow theory-based guidelines, a problem that some have called the scholar-practitioner divide or the “rigor-relevance gap.” Claeys and Opgenhaffen explore this gap to shed light on specific reasons why practitioners who know principles of crisis communication still resist the application of those principles when faced with an actual crisis. They found that reasons for practitioners to not apply theory include considerations related to timing, circumstance, and context (both legal and cultural). The authors conclude their article with concrete suggestions for ways in which scholars and practitioners can better bridge the divide between theory and practice. Dimensions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) skepticism and their impacts on public evaluations toward CSR Like crisis communication, another area of interest to both scholars and practitioners has been corporate social responsibility or CSR, a term that seems more frequently used than it has ever been rigorously defined. To begin remedying the latter, Hyejoon Rim and Sora Kim draw on literature from various fields to distinguish the multidimensional concept of CSR skepticism from skepticism in its many other forms, exploring this concept as both a situational and dispositional trait. Then, the authors tested four statistical models to determine that publics’ responses toward CSR skepticism is best predicted by three factors: Skepticism toward a company’s CSR altruism, disbelief regarding a company’s CSR communications and activities, and skepticism toward the informativeness of a company’s CSR efforts. This study advances public relations theory by offering a strong conceptual definition of and measurement for CSR skepticism, and the article yields numerous directions for research, including future studies to validate the measurements proposed here, as well as to determine the applicability of those measurements to non-US populations. Beyond mere information transfer: The importance of a relational approach to market-related internal communication Turning from external communication of organizational CSR efforts, the article by David Jiménez-Castillo examines internal communication of market-related information and how this affects both the shared interpretation of information and the innovation performance of employees. The author reviews prior research distinguishing internal communication that builds relationships from communication that disseminates task- or job-related information, before advocating a “relational approach to market-related internal communication” (i.e., RAMIC) that integrates both approaches to employee communication, which he tests on Spanish manufacturing companies across different industries. Pragmatically, the results suggest that RAMIC enables organizations to manage the increasingly large amounts of market information and to share that information with employees in ways that do not overwhelm their information-processing capacity. Theoretically, the findings problematize extant conceptualizations of internal communication, which in public relations scholarship has centered on transactional approaches to building organization-employee relationships. Conceptually, the article offers an innovative way to connect marketing scholarship with public relations research beyond the trite 1980s’ turf wars of marketing versus public relations. Indeed, the findings suggest that “public relations managers should take a much more active role in managing communication processes linked to market information” (p. 276), thus underscoring the need for public relations and marketing to work together as organizational functions, rather than perpetuating their conceptual and functional divides.",""

These processes are frequently associated with organizational information dissemination, overlooking other critical contents to make strategic decisions. This study draws market information processing into the debate about internal communication, providing a greater understanding of how a relational approach can improve market intelligence dissemination. Results show that an effective management of market knowledge requires the use of such an approach, which in turn, cultivates the shared interpretation of market information and innovation performance. The findings stimulate fresh discussion about the nature and development of internal communication knowledge and practice.","beyond mere information transfer importance relational market internal communication despite significance relationship management information provision exchange scholarship typically focused underlying internal communication processes transactional perspective processes frequently associated organizational information dissemination overlooking critical contents make strategic decisions draws market information processing debate internal communication providing greater relational improve market intelligence dissemination effective management market knowledge requires use turn cultivates shared interpretation market information innovation performance stimulate fresh discussion nature development internal communication knowledge practice"
"137",2017,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay Historical research within public relations is a relatively new field of scholarship. It may sound contradictory; however, the nature of the discipline and its dynamic expansion academically and professionally has, until recently, limited opportunity to research the phenomenon historically. Attempting to explore the past of the discipline signals, in part, a desire to understand the present and to an extent foresee future directions. This historical quest for knowledge though does not come without challenges. When focusing on historical research and historiography, public relations researchers must become historians, using the same techniques and appropriate methodological approaches as professional historians to explore and analyze the past. Perhaps there may still be skepticism on the ability to do so (J. Xifra, personal communication, July 7, 2016) or acknowledge the existence of professional prejudices (D. Wright, personal communication, July 6, 2016); however, recent scholarship provides a solid argument for the opposite viewpoint. One may also argue that existing tools and models used to capture historical developments are not appropriate (L’Etang, 2014); hence, there is a necessity to provide the space where public relations historians can be critical, reconceptualize paradigms, and become bolder in their analysis of the field. The scholarship of this niche area was offered a substantial platform for development in 2010 with the founding of the International History of Public Relations Conference (IHPRC) by Professor Tom Watson. Since then, expansion of research outputs published yearly in special issues, books, book chapters and the proceedings of the IHPRC is evident. Over the past 7 years, the IHPRC has provided the opportunity for more than 280 papers to be presented and discussed from Asian, Eastern European, Middle Eastern, African, South American, Western European, and North American regions. The papers could be classified under the Watson (2013) typology in those describing and analysing narratives of the past, investigating historical cases, and offering an alternative approach. The latter typology offers a thematic breakdown involving themes on national public relations histories, influential personalities, cases/campaigns that were affected (even unintentionally) by public relations, and finally those that offer future historiographic directions. This special issue hosts research outputs presented during the seventh IHPRC, held at Bournemouth University in July 2016, as well as the work of other public relations historians who responded to the call for manuscripts. The four articles, in alphabetical order, are the following: William B. Anderson, using the American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA) as a case study in his article “Social movements and public relations in the early twentieth century: How one group used public relations to curtail venereal disease rates,” introduces some antecedents of contemporary public relations. Public relations is examined in relation to social movements and how ASHA members used persuasive communication via audience segmentation, events, visual media, and the creation of house organs to get their messages across. Public relations and public relations-like activities are highlighted in ASHA’s campaign to make sexual health an issue for the public in the early 20th century. Natalia Rodríguez-Salcedo and Beatriz Gómez-Baceiredo in “A herstory of public relations: Teresa Dorn, from Scott Cutlip to Burson-Marsteller Europe (1974–1995)” explore the developments of a world-renowned consultancy under the influential leadership of Teresa Dorn in the newly established democracy of Spain. Through oral and archival history, the authors offer insight on the difficulties and prejudices that a female practitioner of the time had to face while guiding Burson-Masteller to become one of Spain’s top consultancies. Cylor Spaulding and Melanie Formentin explore the advancement of Scientology as a church denomination to evaluate the role of public relations in this religious movement. The authors’ article, “Building a religious brand: Exploring the foundations of the Church of Scientology through public relations,” provides evidence that allows the evaluation of founder L. Ron Hubbard’s use of public relations to establish the Church of Scientology. Finally, Gareth Thompson’s “Parallels in propaganda? A comparative historical analysis of Islamic State and the Nazi Party” draws a comparative historical analysis between the so-called Islamic State (IS) and the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nazi Party) by applying historical institutionalism and interdiscursive analysis based on communication artefacts from both organizations. While comparing the propaganda operations between the two organizations, the author confirms parallels in 10 categorizations and places into perspective the effectiveness of digital recruitment for IS. Thompson’s findings place IS propaganda in historical context and provide insight on countermeasure communication strategies when considering the youth as a target audience of organizations such as IS. All four articles enrich the literature on public relations history, proving that knowledge creation produced from historical research is valuable for practitioners, researchers, tutors, or students of the discipline. Public relations doesn’t exist in a silo and has a rich history that needs to be told accurately and interpretatively.",""

Although these efforts might not have been labeled public relations at the time, this study introduces some precedents of contemporary public relations. In this study, social activism offered a more robust approach to addressing an issue than using media relations alone could do. ASHA members used communication strategies such as segmenting audiences, utilizing events to reach appropriate audiences, using visual media, and creating house organs to arouse public sentiment, influence attitudes, and promote desired behavior. This case study expands public relations history theory by examining why ASHA members practiced public relations as they did. In this case, ASHA used persuasive communication to pierce the veil of silence around venereal disease to craft a national vision for social hygiene and legitimize the group as the major voice on this topic. Lessons from this case can illustrate how public relations can be conducted more effectively, especially in relation to social movements.","social movements early twentieth century group used curtail venereal disease rates case american social hygiene association asha campaign craft national vision social health group used like strategies officials said crystallize public opinion years edward bernays wrote book title efforts might labeled time introduces precedents contemporary social activism offered robust addressing issue using media relations alone asha members used communication strategies segmenting audiences utilizing events reach appropriate audiences using visual media creating house organs arouse public sentiment influence attitudes promote desired behavior case expands history asha members practiced case asha used persuasive communication pierce veil silence around venereal disease craft national vision social hygiene legitimize group major voice topic lessons case illustrate conducted effectively especially relation social movements"

"142",2017,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay: Change and resistance As a doctoral student two decades ago, I was rooting around a library at the University of Maryland looking for different ways to think about “symmetry,” because something about the original notion of public relations being practiced in a “two-way symmetrical model” (see Grunig & Hunt, 1984) felt “off” to me, like it had to many others (e.g., Leichty, 1997; Murphy, 1991). In that library, I stumbled across research by Emmy Noether (1882–1935), whose mathematical equations proved “that symmetry—or change—can only exist simultaneously with conservation or invariance” (Sha, 2004, p. 391). These equations came to be known as “Noether’s Theorem” (Alekseevskii, 1988; Byers, 1999; Ne’Eman, 1999; Noether, 1987). But what struck me even more than Noether’s mathematical brilliance was her persistence in demonstrating it continually against the rigid resistance (and outright discrimination) she faced as she did her work, simply because she was female and Jewish (see Byers, 1999; Noether, 1987). As I have asserted before, the implication of Noether’s Theorem for public relations (at least to me) was that “an organization can behave “symmetrically” while maintaining certain beliefs, principles, or purposes that will never be relinquished” (Sha, 2004, p. 391). And just as the duality of symmetry and conservation resonated with me decades ago, the duality of change and resistance is something that I think about constantly today. Perhaps my pre-occupation with change and resistance is because both phenomena seem to permeate our quotidian existence in ways more visible, more concerning, and more outrageous than in recent history. And I’m not just talking about the political landscape. Change Even in editing this journal, I feel constantly the pressures of both change and resistance. And to be honest, some days, I can’t tell which side I’m on. On the side of change, I often feel that editing an academic journal can be transformative: Learning about new research being done around the world. Mentoring younger scholars in the publication process. Encouraging innovative ideas and new scholarship. Pushing the boundaries of theory in public relations. Resistance But at other times, I feel that academic journal editing is a last bastion of the resistance: Fighting against the rush to decision-making, by taking time to think through difficult editorial decisions. Resisting the emphasis on publication quantity that seems to be the current bureaucratic yardstick for measuring “good research,” no matter its scholarly rigor or provocative insight. Insisting on the importance of scientific endeavor, in a time when some societal forces would have us believe that objective evidence can be ignored because “if there’s a real problem, [God] can take care of it” (see DeMarche, 2017; Jagannathan, 2017; Rozsa, 2017). Co-existence One is tempted to suggest, with no small amount of sarcasm, that perhaps God is “taking care of it” by sending His messengers in the form of scientists and His message in the form of scientific data. After all, God and science can co-exist. Similarly, change and resistance are not opposite ends of a spectrum; they can and do co-exist, both in concept and in our real lives. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1936) claimed that “the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function” (n.p.). And so, journal editors soldier on, trying to function, in the midst of change and resistance. Employee communication, job engagement, and organizational commitment: A study of members of the Millennial Generation The article by Justin Walden, Eun Wha Jung and Catherine Y. K. Westerman advances public relations theory in employee-organization relationships (EORs) by delimiting its conceptual focus to job engagement (as distinct from “organizational engagement” or “organizational commitment”) and by positing job engagement as a mediator between employee communication and organizational commitment. The authors define job engagement “as a positive and fulfilling state of mind characterized by dedication, vigor, and absorption at work” (p. 73), a state influenced by organizational communication in terms of information adequacy, information flow, and interaction supportiveness. Together, these latter three concepts form the operationalization of “employee communication” in this study. In addition to its contributions to public relations theory, the article advances research by focusing on Millennials as a situational public, i.e., one whose members are presently “in the first third of their career” (p. 85), a situation that obviously will change over time. I believe this approach to be much more useful in the long term than the plethora of hand-wringing articles in both trade and academic literature that treats Millennials as a cross-situational public, i.e., one defined by birth year and thus doomed to reflect narcissism, entitlement, and self-centeredness (for one example, see Twenge, 2006). This article also includes an appendix item that explains why the authors did not include any demographic variables in running their SEM analysis. This explanation was originally offered by the authors in their response to a reviewer question, and I hope that including it here enhances reader understanding of both an advanced statistical analysis method and the process of revising manuscripts for journal publication. Dialogues with entrepreneurs in China: How start-up companies cultivate relationships with strategic publics The article by Linjuan Rita Men, Yi Grace Ji, and Zifei Fay Chen advances our knowledge in public relations management by integrating prior research on start-up with existing scholarship on organization-public relationships. The piece articulates a clear definition for start-ups as “small- to medium-sized enterprises in an early stage of development that focus on providing high-tech innovative products and services” (p. 91) and breaks new scholarly ground by investigating the role of public relations in start-ups’ efforts to cultivate relationships in the context of a competitive, fast-growing market (i.e., China). Interestingly, although the entrepreneurs interviewed noted the role of public relations in building relationships with organizational stakeholders, the term “relationship building” was noticeably absent from their explicit definitions of the term “public relations.” Future scholars may learn from the authors’ clear articulation of their procedures for data collection, reduction and analysis, as well as from their reflection on how their personal and professional backgrounds may have affected the execution of those procedures. Exploring trust and distrust as conceptually and empirically distinct constructs: Association with symmetrical communication and public engagement across four pairings of trust and distrust Minjeong Kang and Young Eun Park tease out conceptual and operational distinctions between trust and distrust, which prior literature has tended to treat as opposing ends of a single spectrum. This study breaks new theoretical ground in finding empirical support for the validity of treating trust and distrust as separate dimensions, which opens up the possibility of both conditions existing simultaneously in organization-public relationships. In addition, the study examines how four types of trust-distrust pairings are related to two important concepts in public relations research (i.e., symmetrical communication and public engagement), finding that “the high trust-high distrust pairing consistently showed the strongest, positive association,” (p. 131) compared to other pairing types. This most interesting finding augurs well for the future of public relations scholarship on the concepts of trust and distrust treated as separate dimensions. For example, the measures used in this study for trust and distrust can be applied to different organization types, industries, and contexts. Even more helpful for pushing forward the body of knowledge in public relations, this study underscores that future research on organization-public relationships should investigate further the concept of “distrust,” while carefully avoiding the temptation to equate this concept with “lack of trust” or “low trust.” More broadly, this article underscores that all researchers should explicate carefully the concepts used in their studies.","editors essay change resistance doctoral student decades ago rooting around library university maryland looking ways think symmetry something original

Findings from a survey of members of the Millennial Generation (N = 539) in the United States indicate that job engagement mediates the relationship between employee communication and organizational commitment. It is concluded that when employees are engaged in their work, their commitment to the organization is strengthened and the likelihood of them leaving the organization decreases. Furthermore, an argument is made in light of the study’s findings that engagement and commitment work in concert to strengthen EORs overall. To foster engagement, organizations should remove obstacles to internal information flow and provide ongoing feedback to employees about individual and organizational issues.","employee communication job engagement organizational commitment members millennial generation purpose relationship job engagement components employeeorganization relationships eor survey members millennial generation n = united states job engagement mediates relationship employee communication organizational commitment concluded employees engaged work commitment organization strengthened likelihood leaving organization decreases furthermore argument made light s engagement commitment work concert strengthen eors overall foster engagement organizations remove obstacles internal information flow ongoing feedback employees individual organizational issues"

Symmetrical relationship cultivation strategies suggested in previous literature apply to the start-up context in China with specific variations. New strategies such as vision and value communication, empowerment, authentic communication, and proactive reporting were identified for start-ups to build quality relationships with various strategic publics. Compared with large established corporations, start-ups have unique public relations purposes, needs, and scope of practice.

"145",2017,"academic_research","academic","Exploring trust and distrust as conceptually and empirically distinct constructs: Association with symmetrical communication and public engagement across four pairings of trust and distrust Existing relationship research has interpreted low trust as being equivalent to high distrust and high trust as the evidence of low distrust, which has failed to capture the full scope of the functions of trust and distrust in organization–public relationships. Recent research in this area suggests that trust and distrust might simultaneously exist during relational interactions and might play uniquely positive and negative functions in certain social contexts. The main purpose of this study was to offer a new insight in trust–distrust research by providing distinctions in conceptualization and operationalization between trust and distrust. This study also empirically tested the functions of four pairings of trust and distrust on two core public relations concepts (i.e., symmetrical communication and public engagement). The results from the surveys (N = 704; in 20 companies) of US consumers showed sound discriminant validity of trust and distrust. Further, the statistical results revealed that symmetrical communication and public engagement were most strongly associated with the high trust and high distrust pairing, supporting the utilities of distrust in public relations and the coexistence of trust and distrust in social interactions.","trust distrust conceptually empirically distinct constructs association symmetrical communication public engagement pairings trust distrust existing relationship interpreted low trust equivalent high distrust high trust evidence low distrust failed capture full scope functions trust distrust organizationpublic relationships recent area trust distrust might simultaneously exist relational interactions might play uniquely positive negative functions certain social contexts main purpose new insight trustdistrust providing distinctions conceptualization operationalization trust distrust empirically tested functions pairings trust distrust core concepts e symmetrical communication public engagement surveys n = companies us consumers sound discriminant validity trust distrust statistical symmetrical communication public engagement strongly associated high trust high distrust pairing supporting utilities distrust coexistence trust distrust social interactions"
"146",2017,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay: Relationship matters The notion that public relations is really about relationships dates back to one of the earliest textbooks in our field, when Cutlip and Center (1952) offered “the term, public relations, to describe the principles and practice of communications employed to build good relationships with the public” (p. 5, italics original). The centrality of “relationships” remains in the latest edition of Cutlip and Center’s Effective Public Relations, in which public relations is defined as “the management function that establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on whom its success or failure depends” (Broom & Sha, 2013, p. 2). Yet, not until Ferguson (1984) called for public relations researchers to put more effort into studying “relationships” did this concept begin to get serious scholarly attention. Today, “relationship management” is identified as a key area of scholarship in public relations (Sallot, Lyon, Acosta-Alzuru, & Jones, 2003), with researchers examining strategies for maintaining relationships, antecedents to relationships, and relationship outcomes, in numerous journal articles, book chapters, and edited texts. For some examples, see Broom, Casey, and Ritchey (1997); Bruning (2001); Ledingham and Bruning (2001); Ki, Kim, and Ledingham (2015); Hon and J. Grunig (1999); Huang (2001); Hung (2005); Ki and Hon (2007, 2009); Pressgrove and McKeever (2016); and Sweetser and Kelleher (2016). Despite the plethora of current scholarship on “relationships,” a key tension that remains unresolved in public relations research on relationships between organizations and their publics is that scholars often apply to these meso-level connections concepts and measurements designed for micro-level connections, i.e., interpersonal relationships (e.g., Stafford & Canary, 1991). Can relationships between organizations and publics be fully explained by theories about relationships between people? What exactly constitutes a “relationship”? Can a relationship exist without intentionality on the part of one party or the other? (For example, can an activist public have a “relationship” with an organization that wants nothing to do with it, much like a stalker’s “relationship” with his or her target?) Who authors intentionality in organization-public relationships? Do relationships with publics originate with organizational leadership, the public relations function, or a group of rogue employees? What if one part of an organization desires a relationship while another part of that same organization does not? Can organization-public relationships even be truly “managed” if the public relations function controls neither the publics nor the organization’s dominant coalition? I encourage our scholarly community to think critically about questions such as these, to consider the compositions of the complex entities involved in organization-public relationships, and—indeed—to problematize the very notion of “relationships” in public relations. As a maturing discipline, we now must move beyond the wholesale importing of interpersonal relationship theories and their simple application to organization-public relationships; such is the next frontier in public relations scholarship in the relationship management paradigm. Exploring public relations challenges in a compounding crisis: The pariah effect of toxic trailers This article by Shari R. Veil and Kathryn E. Anthony enhances public relations theory by offering “compounding crisis” as a crisis type that the authors carefully differentiate from the concepts “cascading crisis” (cf. Veil & Husted, 2012) and “double crisis” (cf. Johansen & Frandsen, 2007). The study also contributes to public relations theory by identifying and labeling a “pariah effect” that affects organizations’ willingness to associate (or to risk being perceived as associating) with a specific organization in crisis. Methodologically, the study offers an example of inductive analytic method, in which findings “emerged” from the case analysis. The authors used case evidence from interviews, government reports, Congressional testimony, and news articles to identify six themes reflecting challenges faced by the organization, as well as two meta-themes that encapsulate the study’s key implications. The key result of this research is evidence for the authors’ proposition that, “in a compounding crisis, organizational legitimacy and social capital decrease while stakeholder risk perceptions and attribution of crisis responsibility increase” (p. 145). Furthermore, the study reifies the importance of organizational action, in addition to organizational communication, in public relations (cf. Broom & Sha, 2013). When the relationships fail: A microperspective on consumer responses to service failure Examining service failure as a distinct type of organizational crisis, Zongchao Cathy Li and Don Stacks consider how dissatisfied consumers may become activist “micro-publics,” answering the call from Bardhan (2011) and others to consider how an individual-level phenomenon may build eventually into societal-level concerns (cf. Ihlen & van Ruler, 2009; Toth, 2000). The study applies the exit-voice-revenge framework (see Huefner & Hunt, 2000; Huefner et al., 2002) to a public relations problem, with one key finding being the apparent blurring of these response categories in the social media age. Given the current social media environment in which organizations must operate, this article thus offers a valuable distinction between online and offline revenge behaviors. In addition, the authors offer a detailed explanation of both their procedures for structural equation modeling (SEM) and their SEM analysis decisions. This article demonstrates the appropriate use of SEM to test relationships among concepts, and the authors model a thoughtful discussion of possible reasons for SEM results of nonsignificance (e.g., lack of statistical power, poor operationalization). Such scholarly reflection is valuable not only to readers of this journal, but also to members of the broader academic community, as we all strive to raise the caliber of academic research in general. Motivation with misinformation: conceptualizing lacuna individuals and publics as knowledge-deficient, issue-negative activists The study by Arunima Krishna moves forward public relations theories on the activation of organizational publics by examining a specific type of individual activist, someone who lacks (scientifically accurate) knowledge about an issue, and yet feels both negatively about that issue and strongly motivated to do something about it. The article advances our theoretical understanding of activist publics, and the incorporation of the data-information-knowledge-wisdom framework (DIWK; see Ackoff, 1989) from information sciences demonstrates the theoretical power of incorporating concepts from fields outside public relations. Methodologically, the author’s use of the summation method, as well as her thorough description of its execution, helps facilitate future scholarship using the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) and the situational theory of publics (STP), as most research on the latter originally employed canonical correlation to identify publics arising around issues in a specific situation set (see, for example, historical work cited in J. Grunig, 1997). Furthermore, the disaggregated analysis of results related to constraint recognition, as explained on page 187, suggests that future research into this construct would be very interesting both theoretically and operationally.","editors essay relationship matters notion really relationships dates back earliest textbooks field cutlip center offered term describe principles practice

Specifically, we identified the public relations challenges faced by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency during the formaldehyde travel trailer crisis and examined how the Hurricane Katrina crisis encumbered the agency’s response efforts. We offer a theoretical frame for understanding the public relations challenges inherent in compounding crises and propose that, in a compounding crisis, organizational legitimacy and social capital decrease while stakeholder risk perceptions and attribution of crisis responsibility increase. A new phenomenon termed the pariah effect is offered to explain when an organization experiencing a compounding crisis is ostracized by other organizations that could assist with the crisis response to avoid negative spillover effects that could result from associating with the offending organization. This study also demonstrates how attribution of responsibility in a compounding crisis can create an exigency in which an organization must take actions beyond the scope and original mission of the organization.","challenges compounding crises pariah effect toxic trailers distinct exigency compounding crisis crisis occurs close succession another potentially unrelated crisis organization opportunity rebuild legitimacy identified challenges faced us federal emergency management agency formaldehyde travel trailer crisis hurricane katrina crisis encumbered agencys response efforts frame challenges inherent compounding crises propose compounding crisis organizational legitimacy social capital decrease stakeholder risk perceptions attribution crisis responsibility increase new phenomenon termed pariah effect offered explain organization experiencing compounding crisis ostracized organizations assist crisis response avoid negative spillover effects result associating offending organization demonstrates attribution responsibility compounding crisis create exigency organization must take actions beyond scope original mission organization"

"150",2017,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s Essay: Political Tolerance Versus Tolerant Politics To be honest, I worry a lot about public relations, and I worry a lot about politics. And frankly, editing this special issue on political public relations has done little to assuage my worries. Let me explain. The Merriam-Webster dictionary (2017) offers one definition of politics as “competition between competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership” (n.p.). The implication of this definition is that politics is a zero-sum game, wherein one party wins at the expense of the other party. In perhaps the most obvious example, only one winner can emerge in any electoral contest; the other candidates are by definition losers. Strömbäck and Kiousis (2011) have defined political public relations as: the management process by which an organization or individual for political purposes, through purposeful communication and action, seeks to influence and to establish, build, and maintain beneficial relationships and reputations with its key publics to help support its mission and achieve its goals. (p. 8; emphasis added) The politics of public relations What troubles me about both of these definitions (however realistic and pragmatic they may be) is that neither supports the (perhaps idealized) notion of public relations as being inherently symmetrical in nature (cf. J. Grunig, 1992), seeking to build mutually beneficial relationships (cf. Broom & Sha, 2013; Cutlip & Center, 1952), in a “win-win zone” (cf. Dozier, Grunig, & Grunig, 1995). What worries me about political public relations, then, is the question of whose mission and whose goals will be served by our efforts. Historically, we know that Edward Bernays (1965) ran a successful campaign to encourage women to smoke cigarettes (seen in the 1930s as an assertion of feminist independence, not an invitation to lung cancer). With help from Atlanta publicists Edward Young Clarke and Elizabeth Tyler, membership in the White supremacist Ku Klux Klan went from “only a few thousand” in 1920 to “nearly 100,000” just one year later (Baudouin, 2011, p. 17). At the time of his death in 1934, public relations pioneer Ivy Ledbetter Lee was under fire for his connections to a German company affiliated with the Nazi government (Hiebert, 1966). More recently, the efforts of public relations firm Hill & Knowlton on behalf of Citizens for a Free Kuwait led to US Congressional support for the Persian Gulf War (Lee, 1990). As these examples show, the historical record of our discipline demonstrates that what we now call political public relations has long (if not always) been part of our profession, despite the contemporary, idealized definition of public relations. Indeed, Guth and Marsh (2003) noted that “some historians believe that the development of public relations is a direct result of Western civilization’s first true democracy: the city-state of Athens led by Pericles from 461 to 429 B.C.” (p. 57). Although the definitive resource on public relations history remains Cutlip (1994, 1995), the history chapters of textbooks in our field typically trace the development of public relations-like activities from ancient democracies and the growth of the Roman Catholic Church (which functioned in many respects as its own nation-state) through the American Revolution and subsequent Civil War. (For examples, see chapter 2 in Grunig & Hunt, 1984; chapter 3 in Guth & Marsh, 2003; chapter 4 in Broom & Sha, 2013; chapter 2 in Wilcox, Cameron, & Reber, 2015). In short, the history of public relations has always been political. The marketplace of ideas Several textbooks also note the connection between public relations (historical or current; political or otherwise) and rhetorical traditions, which include public communications designed specifically to persuade (for examples, see chapter 4 in Crable & Vibbert, 1986; chapter 1 in Heath & Coombs, 2006). Along these lines, some have argued that all parties deserve public relations advocacy in the court of public opinion, much like all defendants deserve representation in the court of law (e.g., Fitzpatrick, 2006; see also Heath, 2000). The Public Relations Society of America specifically stated that practitioners “serve the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for those we represent … [and] provide a voice in the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate” (Public Relations Society of America, 2017). Yet, if public relations is truly about both actions and words (e.g., The Page Principles, 2017), an ethical and professional public relations counselor would not only help the client determine what to say, but also recommend corrective actions internal to the organization. Nevertheless, this only works in cases where the mission of the organization is amenable to change. In cases where the very existence of the organization depends on its mission, that mission may always be conserved or maintained (Sha, 2004). For example, no amount of public relations counsel regarding organizational words and actions is likely to result in a prochoice or a prolife organization yielding ground on its fundamental purpose to defend its respective position. How, then, might public relations professionals determine which ideas in the marketplace merit defending more or less than other ideas? The paradox of tolerance I believe that one answer to this challenging question lies in Popper’s (1945) Paradox of Tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. … We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal. (p. 226) Viewed in Popper’s light, the question of which ideas in the marketplace merit defending by public relations becomes the question of whether public relations should defend criminality or promote intolerance. Unlike in the court of law, criminals are not entitled to defense in the court of public opinion. Under this scenario, and given the win-lose definition of political public relations, the losers would be those organizations, people, and viewpoints for which public relations practitioners refuse to work. And the ultimate winner would be our collective civil society that tolerates a greater diversity of viewpoints or that encourages, as Taylor (2013) explained, “an orientation to others that enables collective action that creates a common good” (p. 122). Credibility or credulity? Examining political organization-public relationships in an election of interloping candidates Kaye Sweetser and Nicholas Browning examine the political success of candidates they define as interlopers or intruders in a space or activity, with the key finding that respondents’ dissatisfaction with their own political party did NOT drive support for interloping candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Using Kelleher’s (2009) definition of communicated commitment as “communication in which members of an organization work to express their commitment to building and maintaining a relationship” (p. 176), Sweetser and Browning found that communicated commitment was related to higher satisfaction perceived by voters with both their own political party and the opposing party. Furthermore, as the authors note on page 213, “Across the board, individuals appear satisfied with their relationship with the Democratic Party and dissatisfied with their relationship with the Republican Party, regardless of party affiliation.” Studying relationships between a voter and his/her own political party makes sense, from the political party’s strategic standpoint of trying to increase proparty identification or to encourage proparty voting behaviors. Yet, of broader significance for society is studying relationships between a voter and the opposing political party, as election winners in democratic systems are supposed to govern for the good of all regardless of party affiliation, not merely to govern for the good of their own partisan affiliates and interests. This study underscores the complex interplay of relationships (measured as communicated commitment and conversational voice), credibility (including trust), and political information efficacy. What’s not to like? a qualitative study of young women politicians’ self-framing on twitter Politics is gendered (cf. Celis, Kantola, Waylen, & Weldon, 2016); gender is political and politicized (de Beauvoir, 1953/1989). For example, much has been made elsewhere regarding the 2016 US presidential election in which a man with no prior experience in political office won an electoral victory over a woman described as the “most qualified presidential candidate in history” (Reuters, 2016, n.p.). And really, that entire electoral spectacle reminded me that “No one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or scornful, than the man who is anxious about his virility” (de Beauvoir, 1953/1989, p. xxxi). But, what about electoral contests in which gender may not be a variable, simply because both candidates are of the same gender? Does gender still matter then? Apparently, yes. In her study of how two women candidates for New Zealand’s parliament used Twitter to promote both their own electoral campaigns and their respective party’s political platforms, Susan Fontaine investigates the gendered dimensions of social media use. Her analysis furthers our conceptual and practical understanding of the equalization theory of social media (see Vergeer, 2015), i.e., the notion that social media platforms have leveled the playing field for diverse groups of political actors. The study’s implication for public relations theory—indeed, for any social science discipline’s theory-building efforts—is that gendered dimensions of scholarship and practice cannot be ignored. Agenda-building role of state-owned media around the world: 2014 hongkong protest case The article by Tianduo Zhang, Ji Young Kim, Tiffany Mohr, Barbara Myslik, Liudmila Khalitova, Guy Golan, and Spiro Kiousis explicitly articulates the conceptual connection between public relations and public diplomacy by connecting public relations scholarship on agenda setting and agenda building to a wider research stream on intermedia agenda-building efforts, which are important for public diplomacy purposes. This study’s findings point to the importance of dyadic government relationships for intermedia agenda-building, and they contradict previous research (e.g., Sheafer, Shenhav, Takens, & van Atteveldt, 2014) regarding the impact of state-level homophily on the three levels of agenda building. This study advances public relations theory by distinguishing conceptually between intermedia agenda building and intermedia agenda setting, by conceptualizing state-owned media as an information subsidy, and by empirically testing the impact on agenda building of variables from international and intercultural relations. The latter include the homophily-related variables of culture, democracy, and press freedom, as well as the relationship-history variables of diplomatic ties and historical militarized dispute. I believe future scholars will appreciate the article’s transparency of method, with detailed information on coding criteria and content analysis procedures. And I hope the study’s focus on state-owned Chinese media helps to reduce the ethnocentrism often found in US-based academic journals, in which the United States is the central lens through which scholarly phenomena are viewed, which is in and of itself a problem of academic politics.",""

"154",2017,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay: Language in research Public relations is a management function (see Broom & Sha, 2013; Grunig, 1992; van Ruler & Verčič, 2002). As a management function, public relations reflects perhaps the English-language dominance that has been documented in international management (see Tietze, 2008). As one example, Radanovich (2014) found English language (both spoken and written) to be a barrier to entry to the profession for some Hispanic practitioners in the United States. As another example, van Ruler And Verčič (2002) lamented the US-centric teaching of public relations in Europe, an artifact at the time of academic reliance on US-created (and hence, English-language) public relations textbooks. “Englishization”: Positive and negative Dor (2004) noted the tension between what he termed “Englishization” in the process of economic globalization and the presumed corresponding loss in local languages. In their review of the “literature on linguistic globalization” (p. 271), Steyaert, Ostendorp, and Gaibrois (2011) found three perspectives on this phenomenon: positive, negative, and neutral. The first perspective sees English-language dominance in global business as a positive force that facilitates more-efficient communications and operations. In contrast, the second perspective criticizes English-language dominance as a form of linguistic imperialism that may lead to cultural and ideological imperialism. The third perspective is “ambivalent,” and it “instigates us to research the multiple and often contradictory effects of Englishization as people come to terms with the complexity of multilingualism in everyday interaction and negotiation” (Steyaert et al., 2011, p. 271). In the spirit of this third approach, as it may be seen to pertain to the Englishization of public relations scholarship, I offer in this article some thoughts for authors doing research in a non-English language who seek to publish their work in this English-language journal. Language: Signifier and signified Language is but the representation of a mental image, with Saussure (1916/1983) asserting that spoken words are signifiers of concepts (i.e., the signified) and that both signifier and signified are inextricably linked to each other; together, the signifier and the signified form a linguistic sign (Saussure, 1916/1983). From an applied research standpoint, the notion of signifiers and their signified imply at least three challenges: First, researchers are relying on the ability of study participants to express their own mental concepts through language. This is particularly a challenge for scholars using qualitative methods, often for the very purpose of being able to privilege the voices of research participants (see, for example, Marshall & Rossman, 2011). Second, researchers must then convey the information collected from study participants about their perceptions of a given empirical phenomenon. This conveyance of quantitative data typically involves statistics, but the conveyance of qualitative data might take a variety of forms (for details, see Miles & Huberman, 1994; and Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014). But research findings alone do not typically a journal article make. Thus, third, researchers must use the scholarly language of an academic article to convey theoretical concepts, which is where the problem of Englishization comes in. Can the English language fully signify mental concepts that exist in non-English-language-based cultures? I doubt it. If we rely strictly on the English language for academic publications in public relations, are we going to miss important signifieds and their signifiers? I am certain of it. Mitigation: In manuscripts and in the discipline Pragmatically, these challenges might be mitigated in a variety of ways, both in individual manuscripts and in the public relations field as a whole. First, I recommend the transparent disclosure of the language(s) used in data collection. Where English-language concepts are studied with non-English-using research participants, scholars should explain not only the language of data collection, but also the translation of research instruments and of in-language raw data. Who did the translations and what were their qualifications for doing so? What quality-control measures (e.g., back-translations) were undertaken to ensure that the translations were both accurate and meaningful? Second, I welcome the honest sharing of translation challenges in the method section of manuscripts. For example, van Ruler and Verčič (2002) discussed how the English-language term public relations means “relations with the public” in Germanic and Slavonic languages … except that the very term public has a variety of meanings in those languages that do not equate with the term public in English (pp. 3–4). These linguistic nuances should be explored, perhaps by multilingual research teams. Next, over time, I encourage the integration of non-English-language scholarly literature into English-language academic work. Honestly, I have been harping on this stuff for 2 decades: We must strive to integrate local scholarship, including research items developed in the local language. There may be theoretical concepts that English-speakers have not developed simply because we lack the language to articulate them. By incorporating local research into our own, we reduce our reliance on English as the starting and ending points of research—a reliance that limits our knowledge by imposing linguistic boundaries. In addition, cross-cultural scholarship … raises epistemological issues of translation by questioning whether realities studied and understood in one language ever can be recounted sufficiently in another. (Sha, 1999, p. 426) Last, I support the systematic development of non-English-language vocabulary relevant to public relations research and practice. For one example, see the work of Logar Berginc and Verčič (2013) to develop a repository of public relations terminology in Slovenian. Such efforts will become increasingly important to our field as, according to Dor (2004), the increased multilingualism on the Internet “actually works directly against the process of global Englishization by increasing the chances of many languages to survive” (p. 115). Now, on to an overview of this issue’s articles that survived the Journal’s rigorous review process: Elaborating the halo effect of SCCT: How and why performance history affects crisis responsibility and organizational reputation The situational crisis communication theory (SCCT, see Coombs, 2007) has been widely applied in public relations scholarship, but not all research grounded in SCCT has helped that theory to develop further, despite the plethora of publications citing Coombs’ work. This article by Jarim Kim offers an important theoretical contribution by elucidating how and why performance history, including crisis history and prior relational reputation, affects people’s perceptions regarding crisis responsibility and the reputation of an organization in crisis. In short, the study uses qualitative interviews to probe how a company’s performance history has contributed to a “halo effect” that essentially enables its stakeholders to doubt negative aspects of an organizational crisis and to attribute the crisis to an understandable and isolated “one-time mistake” (p. 285). The study also sheds light on why the halo effect works, essentially because of participants’ feelings of personal connection to and trust in the company. In addition to expanding theoretical understanding of the halo effect in crisis communication, this article demonstrates a key strength of qualitative research, to investigate the how and the why of empirical phenomena through the lived experiences of humans in their natural environments, as opposed to the contrived environment of a lab experiment. Also related to method, the article demonstrates appropriate disclosure regarding the languages used in data collection and analysis, as well as contextual background on South Korean businesses. Testing an environmental framework for understanding public relations practitioners’ orientation toward relationship management In another non-US-based study, Seow Ting Lee and Amanda Kee provide empirical data on Singapore, an unusual country in that its levels of political and media freedom have not kept pace with the city-state’s level of economic growth. This study examines the empirical connections between political, economic, and media environments and public relations practitioners’ orientations toward relationship management. The findings have implications for the professionalization of public relations and the ultimate fulfillment of the function’s potential as a manager of mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics. Methodologically, for future scholars, the article collects empirical measures of political system (as perceived degree of democracy), economic system (as perceived levels of economic development and economic freedom), and media system (as perceived level of media freedom). Because political, economic and media systems constitute, in part, what Sriramesh and VerčIč (2003) called “a theoretical framework for global public relations research and practice” (p. 1), I believe that the clear operationalizations of these concepts offered in this article will facilitate future cross-national, comparative research. The bottom line in this study is that “perceived degree of democracy is the only significant predictor of [practitioner] orientation toward relationship management” (p. 269). To me, this finding offers both illumination and direction. If we as public relations scholars care about the continued professionalization of the field, and if we believe wholeheartedly that professional public relations practice must be grounded in the definition of “public relations” as relationship management, then we must support, in ways large and small, the strivings toward democracy made by individuals, organizations, and nations. In short, as these authors suggested, their “findings shape broader understanding of the societal role of public relations in contemporary society and contribute to its melioristic interpretations” (p. 271). I further note that the definition of meliorism is not merely that the world may become better, but that it may improve by human effort. Hello, public relations scholars, practitioners, and students! We are those humans; improving our profession and our world is our calling! Relationship cultivation in public diplomacy: A qualitative study of relational antecedents and cultivation strategies Leysan Khakimova Storie investigates the intersections of political public relations and public diplomacy, concentrating in particular on the process of relationship cultivation, which involves not only initiating relationships, but also nurturing positive relationships and recovering from negative relationships. Three key findings from this study were that “(a) relationships were driven by goals and organizational needs; (b) trust was a necessary component for public diplomacy relationship cultivation; and (c) competition was common among organizations” (p. 302). This research illustrates the benefits of careful qualitative scholarship, exploring extant concepts from organization-public relationships theory in the context of public diplomacy and yielding new theoretical insights. In particular, the study sheds light on the mechanism of third-party introductions in the implementation of networking as a relationship cultivation strategy, provides nuance to the concept of trust with its findings related to “sense of security,” and confirms the notion of time as a dimension of commitment, suggesting that the latter relational strategy is one not merely of affect or intention, but also of actual duration in real time. The author’s suggestions for future research are particularly interesting, in light of global issues related to both politics and public diplomacy: “Future research should also explore how other public diplomacy actors, such as multinational corporations and activist groups, cultivate relationships in the context of public diplomacy” (p. 307). I especially concur with the author that “future research should explore the antecedents, strategies, and especially outcomes of relationship termination and estrangement in public diplomacy” (p. 308).",""

"158",2018,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay: Thoughts on theory The primary purpose of the Journal of Public Relations Research, since its founding, has been to help create, test, refine, or expand theory in public relations. Since commencing my editorship of this journal (work year 2015, credit year 2016), I have come to the chagrined realization that our journal’s very purpose is misunderstood by some authors, reviewers, and readers, for whom the phrase “theory in public relations” may not be quite clear. What is theory? At the most basic level, a theory is an idea or an explanation about how things work. As such, theories might come from a variety of sources that tell us what we know; these methods of knowing originally were articulated as tenacity, authority, taste, and science (see Pierce, 1877), with the method of taste now referred to as the method of intuition (see Wimmer & Dominick, 2014). The point of scientific endeavors (including social scientific efforts, as might be found in public relations) is to offer a method of knowing that is grounded in being public, objective, empirical, systematic, cumulative, predictive, and self-correcting (cf. Wimmer & Dominick, 2014). According to Reynolds (2007), scientific theories exist in at least two forms: (a) a theory can be “a set of well-supported empirical generalizations or ‘laws,’ … referred to as the ‘set-of-laws’ form of theory” (p. 8), or (b) a theory can be “an interrelated set of definitions, axioms, and propositions … called the ‘axiomatic’ form of theory” (pp. 8–9). As explained by Wimmer and Dominick (2014), “[a] theory is a set of related propositions that presents a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relationships among concepts” (p. 12). Really, then, theories are only as useful as the explanations that they can offer. In fact, Babbie (2014) actually defined theory as “a systematic explanation for the observations that relate to a particular aspect of life” (p. 9). Stinchcombe (1968), perhaps, expressed it best when he wrote that “theory ought to create the capacity to invent explanations” (p. 3, italics original). Thus, this journal seeks to publish research that will not only explain public relations phenomena, but also engender the creation of new theories in public relations. How are theories built? Creating new theories and enhancing existing theories are nonlinear processes. The various texts in theory construction all point to the constant interplay between the abstract and the empirical, between the conceptualized and the observed (e.g., Chaffee, 1991; Reynolds, 2007; Stinchcombe, 1968). For specific guidance on building social scientific theories, see the helpful text by Shoemaker, Tankard, and Lasorsa (2004) that literally offers ten steps for building a theory, including specifying both theoretical definitions (step #5) and operational definitions (step #6) for all concepts. Thus, to fulfill its primary purpose of theory-building in public relations, this journal seeks to publish articles that include both kinds of definitions. Defining theoretical concepts requires careful “explication,” an iterative process described by Chaffee (1991) as “the thinking that relates theory with research” (pp. 4–5), by which he meant connecting abstract ideas with empirical observations. In public relations scholarship, Broom, Casey, and Ritchey (1997) began the process of explicating organization-public relationships and in that effort also provided an example of a portion of the explication process. What can budding theorists do? Let me be clear: No research method has a monopoly on theory-building, and this journal continues to welcome scholarship employing all methods of data collection and analysis. No group of scholars or school of thought has exclusive rights over theory building in public relations, and all of us must share the burden of elevating the standards of scholarly work in our field. So, here are some suggestions for those who would engage in the definitely difficult, but fantastically fun, process of theory-building: Create: Connect theoretical concepts that were previously unconnected. Public relations is interdisciplinary, and extant literature in our field draws on concepts from many others. But creative theory building is not necessarily dependent on expertise in another discipline. Rather, as Hage suggested in his Foreword to Shoemaker et al. (2004), creative thinking might simply be facilitated by opening oneself to a variety of information sources, people, and experiences. Test: Apply an existing theory to a new situation, industry, context, country, or language. Then, go further by coming back to the theory to discuss ways in which it worked or failed to work, as well as why or why not. Expand: Add layers of nuance and complexity to the theoretical concept being studied. Consider whether a concept might, in fact, be multidimensional and drill down into each of those dimensions. Refine: Take an existing concept and problematize it. Critique with purpose, to build up, not bring down. Also, manuscripts submitted for review with this journal should include a discussion of the implications of the study’s findings for building theory in public relations. Seriously. As Wirtz and Zimbres (2018) show in their analysis (granted, of a specifically delimited scope) presented in this issue, public relations scholars have more frequently provided practical implications than theoretical implications regarding their work. In other words, we have spent more time telling practitioners how to improve public relations practice than we have spent time telling ourselves how to enhance public relations theory. Ultimately, I still agree with Botan and Hazleton (2006), who argued that “we need to encourage the development of additional and different theories of public relations … [and] … we need to engage in frequent and public debates over the merits and weaknesses of all theories of public relations” (p. 9). After all, the defining characteristic of a scientific theory may be its falsifiability (cf. Popper, 1959). A systematic analysis of research applying ‘principles of dialogic communication’ to organizational web sites, blogs, and social media: Implications for theory and practice. John Wirtz and Thais Menezes Zimbres offer an overdue, systematic analysis of research in public relations that has sought to apply the principles of dialogic communication (cf. Kent & Taylor, 1998) to organizational web sites, blogs, and social media, i.e., what practitioners today would call an organization’s owned media channels. The authors trace the history of public relations scholarly thought on dialogic communication to Pearson (1989), and they articulate a “dialogic communication framework” as “the group of five dialogic communication principles presented in Kent and Taylor (1998)” (p. 6). Furthermore, the article parses out the distinction between dialogic communication and symmetrical communication, two related but distinct concepts that some scholars seem determined to continually conflate (Kent & Lane, 2017). Strengths of this article include its clear articulation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of publications analyzed, the authors’ thorough explanation of the processes by which the codebook and coding categories were developed and refined by the research team, and the detailed explanation of how the content analysis was executed. This methodological clarity and transparency has strong potential for helping future scholars using the content analysis method. The article also offers two important theoretical contributions: First, the authors offer a conceptual definition of dialogic communication as “interactions between organizations and publics that seek to create mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual benefits” (p. 26). Second, the article offers three recommendations for advancing a dialogic theory of public relations: connecting to a larger community of dialogic theorists, reconsidering assumptions about organizational power and equality, and incorporating other forms of communication. Furthermore, Wirtz and Zimbres articulate an important implication of their study’s findings: “studying dialogue or studying some other communication phenomenon” (p. 23) is a scholarly choice. As researchers, we all make choices about where to expend our intellectual capacity and our scholarly energy; as editor-in-chief of this journal, I encourage researchers to choose endeavors that will push the boundaries of theoretical knowledge in public relations. To that end, and in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the publication of Kent and Taylor’s (1998) foundational article on the principles of dialogic communication, the Journal of Public Relations Research will publish, later this year, a special issue on digital dialogic theory, offering scholars the choice to further expand theory in this area into the current digital age. Walking the talk: An exploratory examination of executive leadership communication at startups in China The study of leadership is important for public relations, in that public relations practitioners are encouraged to participate in organizational leadership as members of the dominant coalition (cf. Grunig, Grunig, & Dozier, 2002) and in that the public relations function is encouraged to lead decision-making as the organization’s conscience (cf. Bowen, 2008; Neill & Drumwright, 2012; Ryan & Martinson, 1983). Thus, the article by Linjuan Rita Men, Zifei Fay Chen, and Yi Grace Ji is significant for its expansion of public relations theory on leadership and extension of this area of research into the contexts of start-up companies in China. The authors found that executive leaders’ management styles and character shape organizational culture, which they categorized into five types: innovation/adventure, openness, inclusiveness/participation, supportiveness, and aggressiveness/competitiveness. Effective leadership communication strategies were found to be symmetrical, transparent, authentic, and visionary. On one hand, these findings offer practical suggestions for enhancing the communication efforts of executive leaders in Chinese start-ups. On the other hand, the study also yields significant implications for developing theory at the intersection of public relations and leadership communication, in particular with the identification of visionary communication, which “emphasized the value and contributions of the company for high purpose in a broad social, cultural, economic, or political context” (p. 48). I look forward to future scholarship that further explicates this concept, perhaps by connecting it to real-world public relations phenomena in other countries, with different organization types, and under various leadership demographics.","editors essay thoughts primary purpose journal since founding help create test refine expand since commencing editorship journal work year credit year come

"161",2018,"academic_research","academic","Notes on a dialogue: twenty years of digital dialogic communication research in public relations Historically speaking, the use of mass communication channels in public relations practice has mirrored the diffusion of new technologies. Early 20th century public relations efforts largely relied on newspapers and magazines as channels to promote clients and causes. Radio and television became staple tools for public relations upon their introduction and mass diffusion through society. By and large, these technologies were one-way communication tools for public relations to transmit information to publics, and most often content must have first passed the scrutiny of media gatekeepers. However, with the introduction and widespread penetration of the Internet, public relations practitioners could communicate directly with publics on an unprecedented scale without the approval of media gatekeepers or conformity to their rules. Through so-called Web 1.0 platforms, like websites and early blogs, practitioners could create their own content and directly reach their publics—and they had no idea what to do. Early research on the adoption of Internet-enabled technologies by practitioners suggests they were indeed confused about what to make of this fledgling communication tool. Some embraced the new platform; others viewed it as a distraction. By the turn of the century, it was still considered noteworthy for public relations practitioners to utilize websites for public relations purposes, and many regarded the technology with skepticism as to its strategic value (Hill & White, 2000). It was within this murky and uncertain technological environment that Kent and Taylor (1998) proposed the five principles of dialogic communication in their article, “Building Dialogic Relationships Through the World Wide Web.” The article was the first comprehensive theoretical framework to guide the field of public relations in its use of digital communication. Their work was among the earliest public relations studies to recognize the relationship-building potential of digital communication technology (at that time, mostly websites) and to provide strategies for communication professionals seeking to build relationships with publics. In the 2 decades since the article’s publication, the dialogic principles have become a touchstone for the public relations literature, and Kent and Taylor’s (1998) article outlining the principles is among the most cited and influential articles in public relations history. The principles have been applied in fields such as public relations, advertising, marketing, management, organizational communication, and information studies. Hundreds of studies have used the dialogic principles to analyze various types of organizational websites (McAllister-Spooner, 2008; Taylor, Kent, & White, 2001; Yang & Taylor, 2010) and, more recently, social media accounts such as blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (e.g., Bortree & Seltzer, 2009; Gao, 2016; Linvill, McGee, & Hicks, 2012; Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010). Over the years, studies have attempted to verify and adapt the original principles, applying them within new contexts and relating them to various organizational characteristics (see Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018, for a comprehensive review of studies involving the principles of dialogic public relations). Unlike 20 years ago, computer-mediated communication is now an indispensable part of public relations practice. It is clear from the state of research and practice in public relations that the question is no longer if, but how to best use digital communication technologies to build relationships with publics. With new ways of engaging stakeholders on digital platforms and much wider-spread adoption of digital communication by organizations around the world, it is time to take another look at where we are and ask difficult questions about the potential for dialogic communication through digital media. For this purpose, at this 20-year anniversary, we dedicate this special issue to digital dialogic communication research by showcasing a number of articles that extend our thinking on dialogic theory and use this vital platform to raise interests and point to new directions. Understanding the dialogic promise Prescriptive theories of dialogue, such as those advanced by Pearson (1989), Botan (1997), and Kent and Taylor (1998, 2002), are heavily influenced by the work of Martin Buber (1970), wherein dialogue is seen as a specialized form of interpersonal communication. In brief, dialogue is foremost concerned with the attitudes held by each party in an interaction. Genuine dialogue sees communication partners as equals (I-Thou), rather than as mere recipients of persuasive messages (I-It). Botan (1997) explained that dialogue “elevates publics to the status of communication equal with the organization” (p. 196) as opposed to treating publics as objects to be segmented and responded to. Kent and Taylor (1998) took up the challenge of translating this deeply interpersonal theory to web-mediated communicative relationships. The aim of their work was to provide theory-based strategies to enhance organization–public relationships by making the Web more “personal.” These strategies—grounded in the assumptions of dialogue—took the form of five principles of web-based communication: the dialogic loop, features that allow publics to ask questions and for organizations to respond; usefulness of information, providing information of value to publics in a clear and logical structure; generation of return visits, features that attract publics back to websites and ways to create long-term relationships; intuitiveness/ease of interface, the simplicity and ease of website navigation; and conservation of visitors, features that conserve a user’s time and keeps them on the website. By building these strategies into websites, Kent and Taylor argued, organizations could work to fulfil the “dialogic promise” of digital media, thereby successfully integrating a form of interpersonal dialogue into web-based communication. The work attracted considerable attention because it not only reflected the field of public relations’ keen interest in using digital technologies for organization–public relationship building (the potential for which was unclear at that time), but also answered urgent calls for theorizing on this new communication platform. The principles have since been adapted in various studies, and measures have been developed aimed at demonstrating the degree to which each principle is manifested on website platforms (e.g., Taylor et al., 2001; Yang & Taylor, 2010). These instruments enabled researchers to gauge the extent to which organizations’ websites are dialogic (McAllister-Spooner, 2009) and examine the connection between utilization of dialogic principles and actual responsiveness and accessibility (Callison & Seltzer, 2010). The instruments have also been extensively applied in the examination of organizations’ social media communication. Indeed, the principles are more popular than ever before, with numerous studies utilizing the approach to understand organization–public relationship building through social media. Much of this research has found that although social media, as platforms, exhibit more dialogic potential than websites (e.g., Seltzer & Mitrook, 2007), many organizations still fail to fully utilize the potential of social media to be dialogic (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010), primarily using social media as tools for one-way information dissemination. 20 years of dialogic communication research: what’s next? An important goal of this special issue is not to simply look back and summarize what we have learned over the past 20 years, but also to discern new directions for theoretical development in digital dialogic communication research. To begin such a task, we must first understand the existing gaps and criticisms in the digital dialogic literature. Criticisms of the dialogic approach One of the most prominent criticisms, and perhaps failings, of the dialogic communication literature is the frequent conflation of dialogue with symmetrical communication (Grunig, 2001), where researchers “reify dialogue as a set of procedures” (Kent & Lane, 2017, p. 571), and equate any back and forth of communication with dialogue. This confusion often manifests in studies where researchers simply treat the presence of any interactive features or functions on organizations’ websites and social media accounts as evidence of a dialogic approach. In addition, the principles of dialogic communication have also been challenged by practitioners who fail to see value from the dialogic approach in daily practice, or are constrained by their issue positions or organizational resources to implement dialogic communication (Sommerfeldt, Kent, & Taylor, 2012). Others have criticized the theory for failing to account for power imbalances between organizations and their publics and the influence of factors such as social, political, and economic contexts on dialogic communication (Ihlen & Levenshus, 2017; Roper, 2005). Additionally, as technological innovations continue to revolutionize communication processes, emerging trends such as artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning may all pose new questions and challenges to dialogic communication and require the theory to evolve and adapt—or risk becoming irrelevant. New media environment, new challenges Some studies have begun exploring expansions or modifications of the dialogic principles in light of advances in digital communication technology, and more interactive social media platforms (Bortree & Seltzer, 2009; Gao, 2016; Linvill et al., 2012). Nonetheless, most of these efforts have focused on improving or modifying measurements; few have considered the actual fit between the original dialogic principles and characteristics of contemporary social media. As an example, many studies utilizing the principles choose to simply omit the ease of interface principle, as digital platforms like Facebook and Twitter provide the same interface for all users. A substantial extension of dialogic communication theory might, therefore, come from a deeper consideration of the unique characteristics of the social media communication context and their match or mismatch with dialogic principles; or through providing new connections among previous concepts, and exploring the practical implications of these connections. In any case, scholars should begin to question the applicability of the principles to the social media environment, and adapt—or even remake—them accordingly. Big data, social networks, and new methodological possibilities A new and exciting trend is the availability of big data and analytic tools that allow practitioners and scholars to assess publics’ online behavioral patterns at an unprecedented scale. Much like the case 20 years ago, the field of public relations is again at a crossroads, where data-driven insights are taking the field into new directions. Meaningful theories need to be able to answer the call of their times. For dialogic communication research to advance in this new age, scholars need to go beyond content analysis (a method used in the overwhelming majority of dialogic communication studies; cf. Wirtz & Zimbres, 2018), and embrace new methodological approaches such as big data, social networks, machine learning, and the triangulation of these methods. New methodological approaches would perhaps afford scholars the opportunity to develop new indicators of dialogic communication—perhaps even recognize new forms of enacting dialogue—and better model and predict outcomes of dialogic communication. New methodologies could also offer new approaches to examine the connection between dialogic feature utilization and actual responsiveness. Questioning the dialogic promise Systematic efforts should be taken to examine organizational and institutional barriers to the adoption and implementation of dialogic communication. Questions such as what institutional contexts, power dynamics, and socio-cultural contexts are more conducive or constraining for dialogic communication; how communication practitioners navigate complex stakeholder relationships and institutional barriers to engage stakeholders in dialogue need to be asked. Answering these questions may provide practical implications for practitioners who are puzzled about the applicability and relevance of dialogic communication. Finally, whereas most studies assume that dialogic communication brings positive, or at least benign, outcomes, little attention has been paid to examine the potential negative consequences of dialogic communication. Is there a dark side to dialogue? Kent and Taylor admit that engaging in the appearance of dialogue may be used for malfeasant purposes. Relatedly, are honesty, transparency, and mutuality always a possibility in digital communication? Moreover, what can we do to prevent unintended consequences on organizations, especially in the age of social media? After all, studies have consistently found most organizations fail to fully realize the dialogic promise of digital media. Answers to these questions could deepen our understanding of dialogic communication and revise the framework for the age of Facebook, Twitter, and future platforms with possibly even greater interactive potential and relationship building capacity. Contributions to the dialogue Digital communication will continue to dominate public relations practice and scholarship for the foreseeable future. If we hope to fully realize the potential of social media to be truly social and engage in dialogic relationship building, we must advance digital dialogic scholarship. The articles in this special issue are an effort toward that end. Each of these articles addresses a different facet of dialogic communication research and provides heuristic questions for future scholarship. First, Morehouse and Saffer examine the knowledge-construction networks of dialogic communication in 20 years of public relations literature. Their examination of scholarship networks in the field provides insights into the state of digital dialogic research and suggests that scholars must continue to mix their expertise and adopt different approaches to the study of digital dialogue. Next, Men, Tsai, Wan-Hsiu, Chen, and Ji add complexity to the dialogic approach by pairing examination of the dialogic principles with the concept of social presence—the extent to which an actor appears to be a real person online. As the roots of the dialogic approach are in interpersonal communication theory, the consideration of social presence on social media platforms provides an interesting new approach to examine the efficacy of dialogic communication with publics. Third, Uysal considers the dialogic principles in the context of investor relations and corporate social performance, revealing that more socially responsible corporations are more likely to engage in dialogic communication behavior. Finally, Ciszek and Logan question the relevance of the dialogic principles in social media research, and suggest that alternative perspectives such as dissensus and agonism may better reflect the nature of organization–public interactions, particularly in discussions on difficult social issues.","notes dialogue twenty years digital dialogic communication historically speaking use mass

Our analyses of 157 journal articles reveal core studies that have shaped the use of theories and concepts within dialogue and digital dialogic research. We found evidence that knowledge construction is rapidly growing as researchers are mixing their expertise. Our data suggests that researchers are primarily informed by excellence and/or dialogic theories, but relationship management bridges the various theories used in dialogue research. Finally, we find that a select few scholars inform a considerable amount of the current research on dialogue and digital dialogic communication.

Results showed that top social CEOs used a variety of dialogic principles on Facebook. Yet, 1-way information strategies were still more commonly used. Critically, dialogic principles, such as providing information of interest to publics and creating dialogic loops and the affective and cohesive strategies for projecting social presence effectively enhanced public engagement outcomes of reactions, likes, shares, and comments.

Using the KLD CSP dataset, the study constructed a sample of S&P 500 petro-chemical companies (N = 106) with four levels of corporate environmental responsibility performance (green, gray, toxic, and neutral). The findings provided empirical evidence that green companies were more likely to facilitate dialogic communication with stakeholders.

"166",2018,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay: Identity and/in/of public relations In this themed issue, the Journal looks at the intersection of public relations and identity, which has been part of my academic research agenda for decades, inasmuch as the concept of identity has been an area of personal interest for me since childhood. Even before I knew any words to attach to the concept of identity, my lived experiences etched the importance of identity into my mind and thus into my intellectual journey. As one example, in my kindergarten class at Morningside Elementary in Salt Lake City, Utah, students returned from Thanksgiving break to report on what they had eaten the past Thursday with their families. Feeling very embarrassed and out of place, I shared that my (immigrant) family had eaten noodles; all my classmates, one after another, recounted turkey-centered meals accompanied by various side dishes (none of which were noodles). As a college junior studying in France, I was publicly accosted by a White Frenchman who screamed at me (in French) that France was not a Japanese colony and that I should “go home,” never mind that my heritage is Chinese (not Japanese) and that my home was (and remains) the United States, not anywhere in Asia. Identity research in public relations In some ways, the start of identity-related research in public relations began with the work of scholars investigating such lived experiences of minority practitioners, particularly African Americans and Hispanic Americans (e.g., Kern-Foxworth, 1989; Kern-Foxworth, Gandy, Hines, & Miller, 1994; Layton, 1980; Len-Rios, 1998; Zerbinos & Clanton, 1993), as well as women (e.g., Cline et al., 1986; Toth & Cline, 1989). Later research connected various theoretical concepts in public relations to identity-defined practitioner groups delineated by race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation (e.g., Ciszek & Logan, 2018; Ki, 2004; Mundy, 2015; Pompper, 2004, 2007; Sha, 1995, 2006; Sha & Ford, 2007; Tindall, 2009; Tindall & Waters, 2013). Other research at the intersection of identity and public relations has examined the concept of identity beyond the boundaries of cultural groups. For example, Curtin and Gaither (2005) examined identity as one of five moments in their cultural-economic model of public relations. Sha (2009) connected organizational identities to organizational mission statements and public relations behaviors. Lellis (2012, p. 508) articulated “cause identity” as being a strong collective identity shared among organizations allied in support of a social cause. Sha, Tindall, and Sha (2012) connected organizational identity to corporate image and reputation. Ma (2018) examined the impact of organizational identity on publics’ attributions of guilt to organizations in times of crisis. Ni, Wang, and Sha (2019) incorporated identity into a theoretical framework for managing relationships (and conflict) with organizational publics. In short, identity research in public relations, like the essence of identity itself, is constantly evolving. In the words of Hall (1994): Cultural identity … is a matter of “becoming” as well as of “being.” It belongs to the future as much as to the past. It is not something which already exists, transcending place, time, history, and culture. Cultural identities come from somewhere, have histories. But, like everything which is historical, they undergo constant transformation. Far from being eternally fixed in some essentialised past, they are subject to the continuous “play” of history, culture, and power. (p. 225) Identity of public relations Just as public relations scholarship in the area of identity has evolved over time, so has the identity of public relations itself, both as a professional practice and as an academic discipline. Indeed, one of the challenges of being a journal devoted to the development of theory in public relations is that, at times, the very definition of public relations is unclear. Traditionally, core knowledge—such as definitions—of a subject area is disseminated in a field’s textbooks (Hilty, 2011), even though such knowledge, as disseminated, has sometimes generated both political and cultural controversy (cf. Britton, Woodward, Binkley, & Woodward, 1993). In the most recently available citation analysis of public relations scholarship, Pasadeos, Berger, and Renfro (2010) noted that, from 2000 to 2005, the top-cited textbooks in public relations were Grunig and Hunt (1984) and Cutlip, Center, and Broom (1985, 1994). In their textbook, Managing Public Relations, Grunig and Hunt (1984) deﬁned public relations as the “management of communication between an organization and its publics” (p. 4). The most-recent edition of Cutlip & Center’s Effective Public Relations textbook defines public relations as “the management function that establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the publics on whom its success or failure depends” (Broom & Sha, 2013. p. 2). Although textbooks and professional associations in the field have offered myriad variations on definitions of public relations, four consistent elements across definitions are specified or implied to be (a) a focal organization or some other originator of activities and communications, (b) a public defined in relation to that organization or originator, (c) the organization-public relationship, and (d) the management of that relationship. In this themed issue on identity and public relations, three articles examine the intersection of identity and public relations in quite different ways, while reflecting the history of not only that intersection, but also the field itself. Queering PR: Directions in theory and research for public relations scholarship Hall’s (1994) assertion that identity is a process of becoming, inasmuch as it is a matter of being, is well reflected in the article by Erica Ciszek, who offers some political and theoretical foundations of queer theory and articulates why queer theory should, and does, matter to the identity of public relations. For starters, queer theory is not about studying any specific identity group (e.g., lesbians or gays), but about critiquing, problematizing, and deconstructing identities, which themselves are “multiple, unstable, and fluid,” as Ciszek notes on page x. As we enter an era of fluid identities, this article’s call for “proceeding queerly” (p. x) places public relations research squarely in the midst of that challenge, positioned to interrogate the subjectivities and intersectionalities of organizational publics and organizations themselves. In that process, scholars should carefully consider “the role of public relations in the production of a culture of normativity and the processes of constructing practices and identities that reinforce hierarchies” (p. x). For this journal in particular, Ciszek’s work reminds us that the very definition of theory in a journal purporting to advance theory in public relations should be interrogated, as should be the notions of research and the standards by which that research that is deemed scientifically sound. Indeed, if “queer inquiry is a theoretical approach that problematizes binaries, resists identity as essential, challenges categorization, examines underlying power relations, and reveals contextuality,” as Ciszek notes (p. x), then what is the impact of queering on we scholars, ourselves? If queer theory, indeed, breaks down all categories, including binary ones such as scholar/practitioner, then who are we as humans in this category labeled “scholars?” If our own scholarly identity is both unstable and fluid, what impact does that have on the success or failure of individual public relations scholars in the tenure and promotion processes currently in place in universities? And if our disciplinary identity is so multiple and in flux, how do (or should?) we maintain our academic space as requiring independent curricular programs, or our academic place as meriting a discipline-centered research journal? Understanding immigrant internal publics of organizations: Immigrant professionals’ adaptation and identity development Taking a different scholarly approach to questions at the intersection of identity and public relations, Lan Ni, Qi Wang, and Anushree Gogate introduce in their article the concept of intercultural identity, an identity that spans different cultures. Their research extends the notion of avowed cultural identity to investigate the development of identities of immigrant professionals through processes of stress and adaptation. In particular, their investigation into how “cultural identity is formed in the first place and reformed when exposed to a second culture long term” (p. x, emphasis original) makes an important contribution to theory-building in public relations, which, to date, has largely studied cultural identity as a research concept without troubling too much to consider its ontological origins as a lived experience. This article offers methodological exemplars in its careful descriptions of processes of sampling, data collection, data analysis, and researcher reflexivity, all of which demonstrate standards of rigorous scholarship in qualitative research. Furthermore, the conceptual framework presented here demonstrates the value of drawing on theories from other disciplines, in this case from intercultural communication, specifically from intercultural communication competence. Beyond its application in this article to the development of micro-level identities of individual immigrant professionals, the stress-adaptation-growth model (cf. Kim, 2005) might be interesting, I believe, if applied to the meso-level identities of organizations as corporate bodies responding to environmental stressors and adapting to new organizational contexts, possibly growing new identity dimensions in that process. Of course, the concept of intercultural identity also offers fertile ground for future research on organizational publics. In addition to the research directions identified by the authors, future studies might consider immigrant employees working in non-white-collar jobs (e.g., lower-skilled employees), as well as involuntary immigrants (e.g., refugees, trafficked workers, enslaved laborers), all with the appropriate sensitivities and protocols for working with vulnerable research populations. Building theory in public relations: Interorganizational relationships as a public relations paradigm Regarding matters of appropriate sensitivity in research and evolving scholarship in a research field, I note that Mary Ann Ferguson’s article was first presented at an academic conference in 1984, when she issued what turned out to be a foundational call to focus on relationships in public relations research. Apparently, that call was not initially heeded in earnest by the community of public relations scholars, perhaps in part because when the original manuscript was presented, a powerful senior scholar in attendance purportedly pooh-poohed the research. Three decades later, Ferguson’s 1984 conference paper has been cited hundreds of times the world over, including by scholars who may not have ever actually read the manuscript. I came to be in possession of an original copy of the 1984 conference paper years ago, when my San Diego State colleague, Susan Hellweg (who had been in attendance when the paper was presented), was cleaning out her office while getting ready to retire from her academic career. When reviewing manuscripts for this themed issue on identity and public relations, I realized anew that our fundamental identity as a field, that of being grounded in relationships between organizations and publics, owed much to that 1984 Ferguson manuscript, which had never been published. Thus, I called the author and got her permission to print the conference paper. But getting from permission to publication turned out to be an arduous process, as Ferguson herself no longer had ready access to a copy of the manuscript. Thus, I converted my faded paper copy into a hard-to-read portable document file (pdf), which then had to be converted to a less-than-accurate text file (MS Word), so that edits could be implemented. My sincere thanks go to Thomas (T. J.) Alexander and Maria Len-Rios at the University of Georgia for their initial contributions to this painstaking process. Upon receiving the edited text file, I did a word-by-word comparison against my paper copy, which was far more difficult than one would think necessary. From there, I had to make tough calls about what to edit (egregious typos, certainly) and what to leave alone (missing commas, possibly). Ultimately, I believe that, despite the manuscript’s long road to becoming a journal article, its essential being remains pertinent to public relations scholarship today. In particular, I am struck by how well Ferguson’s work foreshadowed current research on the dimensions of organization-public relationships, as well as by how little has evolved in our field. As one example of the latter, I note that the general categories of research induced by Ferguson—social responsibility and ethics, professionalism, education, program implementation, history, public relations as management, communication technology—all are iterated in current public relations scholarship, but relatively precious few manuscripts really focus on public relations theory development. Within those general categories, scholars today ask the same basic research questions that Ferguson notes throughout her article, and educators today feel “equally beset with demands” (p. x) to publish their research, to teach their students, and to serve their institutions. We also still face today the same questions of paradigm, which I would term questions of paradigmatic identity. Even so, I note that identity evolution is likewise reflected in Ferguson’s article. For example, the Association for Education in Journalism has become the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, reflecting an identity shift of a broader discipline to which public relations belongs. The scholar cited in 1984 as L. Schneider is today L. Grunig, and J. Van Slyke is J. Turk, offering a gendered lens through which to glimpse the identity evolution of some individual public relations scholars. To me, the publication of this article in its near-original, conference-paper form offers the following key message to our scholarly community, as we continue to research identity and/in/of public relations: Public relations is still becoming, and we scholars (as humans; or perhaps we humans, as scholars) should continue to interrogate our own ontology, epistemology, and axiology. As we consider ontological questions, we should respect our past, even while problematizing it in the present, toward a fluid future. As we reflect on epistemological questions, we should respect the diversity of views and voices in our discipline, even when chaos and cacophony feel, at times, overwhelming. As we pose axiological questions, we should respect all scholarship done rigorously, regardless of scholarly method, affiliation, or status. And here I offer a special note to graduate students, non-US-based scholars, and those working in marginalized territories of inquiry: Remember that your work is valuable and has value, even if that value is not immediately recognized by the scholarly establishment. Just look at the provenance of this article by Mary Ann Ferguson.",""

This study examined the processes of intercultural identity development through IPs’ stress, adaptation, and intercultural communication competence, as well as the outcomes of such identity development. Twenty-three interviews with Indian IPs in a major southern cosmopolitan area in the United States revealed three types of stressors: insufficiency in culture-specific knowledge and skills, ineffective expression, and imbalance in home and host social communication. Adaptation responses included active language and culture learning, perspective taking, compromising, ignoring, passive acceptance, and active initiating and participating in social interactions. Further, IPs demonstrated three major types of intercultural identities: integrated with both cultures, non-integrated (leaning more toward either home or host culture), and ambivalent (feeling rootless and uncertain about what culture to teach their children). In the context of intercultural identity development, the concepts of avowed and ascribed identities become even more nuanced. This study contributes to research in public relations by deepening the understanding of organizations’ immigrant internal publics and facilitating more effective relationship management with these publics.","immigrant internal publics organizations immigrant professionals adaptation identity development immigrant professionals ips compose important internal publics us organizations processes intercultural identity development ips stress adaptation intercultural communication competence outcomes identity development twenty interviews indian ips major southern cosmopolitan area united states stressors insufficiency culture knowledge skills ineffective expression imbalance home host social communication adaptation responses included active language culture learning perspective taking compromising ignoring passive acceptance active initiating participating social interactions ips demonstrated major intercultural identities integrated cultures nonintegrated leaning either home host culture ambivalent feeling rootless uncertain culture teach children context intercultural identity development concepts avowed ascribed identities become nuanced contributes deepening organizations immigrant internal publics facilitating effective relationship management publics"

"170",2018,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay: From anxiety to action The articles in this issue illustrate various reasons why people may feel anxious or stressed: societal changes, health concerns, social activism, relationships, crises, etc. In short, today’s world appears to offer no shortage of opportunities to feel anxious. Stress and anxiety One study by the American Psychological Association (2017) revealed that 63% of Americans indicated “the future of the nation” to be a significant source of stress, whereas 62% were stressed about money, 61% about work, and 57% about the “current political climate” (p. 1). One year later, the numbers rose to 69% reporting significant stress about the future of the nation, 64% about both work and money, and 62% about the current political climate (American Psychological Association, 2018). In short, stress levels are rising in general, at least in the United States. In some respects, of course, feeling stressed to some extent is normal, because “stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand” (5 Things You Should Know About Stress, n.d., n.p.), and “occasional anxiety is an expected part of life” (National Institute of Mental Health, 2018, n.p.). Defined as “apprehensive uneasiness or nervousness usually over an impending or anticipated ill” and “mentally distressing concern or interest” (Merriam-Webster, 2019, n.p.), anxiety happens to us all, at one point or another. One common instrument used by researchers to measure anxiety is the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) originated by Spielberger, Gorsuch, and Lushene (1970). Extending the conceptual usefulness of the STAI, Siddaway, Taylor, and Wood (2018) found that anxiety can be measured not merely by its presence or absence, but rather on a continuum of anxiety-calmness. Acceptance and action Indeed, keeping calm is one way to oppose the impact of anxiety. Specific anxiety-management strategies recommended by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (n.d.) include: accepting the inability to control everything; maintaining a positive attitude; getting enough sleep and exercise; taking deep breaths; and getting help from family, friends, and professional healthcare providers. Recent studies show that effective strategies for handling anxiety include forms of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; cf. Bluett, Homan, Morrison, Levin, & Twohig, 2014; Swain, Hancock, Hainsworth, & Bowman, 2013). For example, Dehghani, Saf, Vosoughi, Tebbenouri, and Zarnagh (2018) found that sports competition anxiety was decreased in students who underwent a mindfulness- and acceptance-based intervention. Monteiro, Fonseca, Pereira, Alves, and Canavarro (2018) found that women who were more accepting of their situations and of themselves in the form of self-compassion were less likely to develop anxiety and depression post-partum. Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, and Lillis (2006) conceptualized ACT as being composed of six core processes: acceptance, defusion, contact with the present moment, self as context, values, and committed action. Committed action is a pattern of “effective action linked to chosen values” (p. 9). On a similar note, the American Psychological Association (2018) reported that people have been taking action in response to their stress, with 70% of respondents indicating intention to vote and 57% having taken some kind of action in the last year, such as volunteering or supporting a cause, signing a petition, or speaking with family and friends about political views. I wonder if public relations scholarship would benefit from using the extensively validated STAI (cf. Lonner & Ibrahim, 1989) to investigate anxiety as part of our own ongoing research into the role of emotions in the formation of publics (see, for example, Coombs & Holladay, 2005, 2007; Jin, Pang, & Cameron, 2010; Kim & Niederdeppe, 2013). In addition, while committed action as a core process of ACT strategies has very specific connotations in the field of cognitive and behavioral therapy, public relations scholars might consider ways in which this process, as generated in individuals, might extrapolate to organizational publics responding to anxieties of their own. “Public Relations and Social Morality as National Identity: A Cultural-Economic Examination of the US Government’s Fight Against Venereal Disease in the 1920s” William Anderson offers a fascinating examination of three health campaigns conducted by the US Public Health Service in the 1920s to encourage positive social behaviors in a time of social change. His findings underscore the importance of studying producer motivation or intent as a means to clarify the moment of production in the cultural-economic model (CEM) of public relations (cf. Curtin & Gaither, 2005, 2007). Because all five moments are interconnected, the influence of motivation on the moment of production also implies its influence on regulation, representation, consumption, and identity. Indeed, this historically focused article on the crafting of national identity via public relations efforts feels to me quite contemporary, given its examination of that identity during a moment of cultural concern regarding its future. As Anderson explains, the post-WWI increase in immigration (from non-English-speaking countries) and the migration (of African Americans) to cities from rural areas were social forces that appeared to some conservatives to be “changing what it meant to be American” (p. x, emphasis original), and one can hear strong echoes of that perspective in our own current events. Methodologically, the article demonstrates how an historical case study can extend theory in public relations, while emphasizing the importance of avoiding presentism, or judging the past by the standards of the present. I appreciated the author’s reminder of the warning articulated by Lamme and Russell (2010), that public relations scholars avoid a linear approach that treats the history of our discipline as “progressive evolution” (p. 281), in which past practices are viewed as being less sophisticated and less ethical, compared to today’s public relations activities. “From Concerned Citizens to Activists: A Case Study of 2015 South Korean MERS Outbreak on the Role of Dialogic Government Communication and Citizens’ Emotions on Public Activism” Anyone keeping up with current events will be unsurprised by the key finding in this study by Minjeong Kang, Jangyul Robert Kim, and Heewon Cha, that “anger, anxiety, and cynicism significantly motivated citizens’ intentions to take actions against the government” (p. x.). What I found particularly interesting was that, although anger, anxiety, and cynicism all predicted intentions of activism, only cynicism predicted actual activism behaviors (and in a negative direction). This article also elucidates the complex roles played by other variables in the process of getting people from cognition to affect to behavior, including perceptions of dialogic communication, distrust in government, and situational uncertainty. This article demonstrates a thoughtful, nuanced treatment of various related concepts and offers the opportunity to review good practices in moving from the conceptualization to the operationalization of variables. For example, when asked by reviewers during the review process to explain why some variables in the study were treated as summative indices and others were not, the lead author explained, “Anger and anxiety are emotions and to capture the intensity of emotions, summative indices (cumulative) were used for them, while cynicism is a political sentiment, [for] which each item of the scale captured [a] slightly different aspect of the cynical political sentiment” (Kang, 2018, n.p.). The article offers Dillard and Anderson (2004) to justify the summative indexing of emotions and Dean, Brandes, and Dharwadkar (1998) to support the notion of cynicism as multidimensional. Extending public relations theory into non-English-language terrain, the authors also discuss the connotative distinctions between two related terms in the Korean language: So-Tong (communication) and Dae-Wha (dialogue). What can English-language scholarship in public relations learn from these distinctive Korean words? What are the theoretical implications of exploring English-language-grounded concepts in a non-English language (cf. Sha, 2017)? I look forward to future studies shedding light on these questions. “The Influence of Distal Antecedents on Organization-Public Relationships” In their article, Trent Seltzer and Nicole Lee extend the conceptual clarity of the notion of relational antecedents by offering a conceptual model of organization-public relationship (OPR) processing, while taking care to note that their study centers on OPR perceptions and is delimited to the empirical investigation of only a portion of the full conceptual model. Drawing on literature from motivated processing and perceived congruence, the authors integrate these concepts with extant OPR scholarship to assert that relational antecedents fall into two categories: Antecedents can be distal, such as those that motivate the initiation of relationships, or proximal, such as those that cultivate and manage relationships after they are established. The authors empirically investigate five types of potential motivations for people to initiate a relationship with an organization: perceived social and/or cultural expectations, perceived expectations of valued others, perceived need for resources, perceived need for risk reduction, and perceived legal obligation to associate (cf. Broom, Casey, & Ritchey, 1997, 2000). The findings point to the importance of perceptions of social/cultural expectations in initiating the establishment of relationships between individuals and the various focal organizations studied, regardless of organization type. In addition, this study’s finding that “perceived value congruence accounted for the most unique variance” (p. x) in OPR perceptions poses interesting questions for future scholars. For example, given the importance of value congruence as suggested by this study, research on corporate social values and corporate social responsibility would benefit from thoughtful consideration of those concepts as potential distal antecedents to OPRs. I would also love to see future research implementing the suggestion of Seltzer and Lee (2018) to “consider the lifespan of an OPR” (p. x). After all, if relationships can be initiated, can’t they be terminated? “Hierarchical Consistency of Strategies in Image Repair Theory: PR Practitioners’ Perceptions of Effective and Preferred Crisis Communication Strategies” The article by Denise P. Ferguson, J. D. Wallace, and Robert C. Chandler examines the message strategies propounded by Benoit’s (1995, 1997) image repair theory (IRT) for organizations to use in responding to crises. The authors also provide a solid overview of Coombs (2007) situational crisis communication theory, which connects the IRT strategies for organizational responses in crises to three clusters of situation types differentiated by the extent to which publics attribute responsibility for the crisis to the organization: victim cluster, accidental cluster, and preventable cluster. The piece also reminds scholars of more recent scholarship (e.g., Kim & Sung, 2014) recommending that all organizations facing crisis management provide instructing and adjusting information (i.e., a base response), before selecting reputation management responses. This study contributes to public relations theory by its explicit inclusion of silence as a message response strategy and its finding that silence was least or second-to-least likely to be recommended by practitioners as a message response strategy. The findings also were interesting in the apparent stability of rankings of practitioners’ perceptions of the effectiveness of crisis response strategies across three scenarios, thus begging the question of whether the situational crisis communication theory remains relevant in its emphasis on the situational. That said, it’s also possible that these results were the product of a relatively limited set of three crisis scenarios. Nevertheless, the study’s findings suggest that scholars examining the motivations for crisis responses should look less at ethical or motivational concerns and more at pragmatic reasons why practitioners choose and recommend the use of specific crisis response strategies. Methodologically, the authors used the membership list of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) as their sampling frame, which reflects similar approaches to data collection done in the past on public relations practitioners. Yet, obtaining permission to use membership lists from professional associations has become increasingly difficult, and the limitations of this method—as noted by the authors—are real. Prior research has shown demographic differences between PRSA organizational membership and the population of those claiming to practice public relations in the United States, as documented by census data (e.g., Hazleton & Sha, 2012). I support the authors’ call for shorter survey instruments and also encourage the incorporation of attention-check items in longer questionnaires, to prevent potentially rote selection of answer options by fatigued respondents.","editors essay anxiety action issue illustrate reasons people feel anxious stressed societal changes health concerns social activism relationships crises etc short

Through a case study of the 2015 Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea, the results of a survey of 400 South Korean citizens showed that distrust in government and a high level of situational uncertainty were significantly mitigated by citizens’ perceptions of government efforts for dialogic communication during the crisis. Conversely, when the perception of dialogic government communication was low, high distrust in government increased cynicism, anger, and anxiety among citizens; high situational uncertainty led to higher levels of anger and anxiety, but not cynicism. Consequently, the findings showed that anger, anxiety, and cynicism significantly motivated citizens’ intentions to take actions against the government. Direct and positive effects of anger, anxiety, and cynicism on activism participation were not found and were mediated by the citizens’ activism intentions.","concerned citizens activists case south korean mers outbreak role dialogic government communication citizens emotions public activism investigated cognitiveaffectivebehavioral sequence public activism role citizens perception government dialogic communication national pandemic crisis case middleeast respiratory syndrome mers outbreak south korea survey south korean citizens distrust government high level situational uncertainty significantly mitigated citizens perceptions government efforts dialogic communication crisis conversely perception dialogic government communication low high distrust government increased cynicism anger anxiety citizens high situational uncertainty led higher levels anger anxiety cynicism consequently anger anxiety cynicism significantly motivated citizens intentions take actions government direct positive effects anger anxiety cynicism activism participation mediated citizens activism intentions"

"175",2019,"academic_research","academic","Editor’s essay: committing to community Community and public relations research The idea that public relations and community are connected concepts can be traced to Kruckeberg and Starck’s (1988) book, which argued that “public relations is best defined and practiced as the active attempt to restore and maintain a sense of community” (Kruckeberg & Starck, 2004, p. 136). Furthermore, Hallahan (2004) believed that “community” was a promising conceptual foundation to further develop both public relations theory and public relations practice. He defined community as “any group that shares common interests developed through common experience” (p. 243). Hallahan (2004) not only offered a helpful overview of “community” as defined in various disciplines, but also noted wisely that those definitions could be placed on a “continuum from purely geographic communities to purely symbolic communities” (p. 235). Similarly, Underwood and Frey (2007) noted that “community” can be conceptualized using not only physical attributes, but also psychological ones, echoing the work of earlier scholars (e.g., Hillery, 1955; McMillan & Chavis, 1986). Today, contemporary technologies such as digital media have shifted the focus of community toward the symbolic end of the continuum, in that “communities” are less geographically based and more digitally gathered (e.g., Toledano & Maplesden, 2016; Valentini, Kruckeberg, & Starck, 2012). In this context, physical parameters for a given community become less important than psychological parameters, which include a sense of belonging as one marker of a sense of community (cf. Bernstein & Norwood, 2008). Ultimately, the recommendations from Kruckeberg and Starck (1988) for how public relations can contribute to a sense of community remain on point: “helping community members and their organizations become conscious of common interests; helping individuals in the community to overcome alienation; helping individuals find security and protection through association with others; actively taking part in community projects promoting progress; and helping foster personal friendships” (Valentini et al., 2012, p. 875). Community among public relations scholars My own introduction to the public relations academic community began of course with my mentors and professors, including Dick Crable, Steve Vibbert, and Krishnamurthy Sriramesh at Purdue; then Lauri Grunig, Jim Grunig, and Linda Hon at Maryland; followed by my mentors and colleagues Glen Broom and David Dozier at San Diego State. At my very first academic conference presentation, the paper discussant was Dean Kruckeberg, and the only audience member (because it was an 8 a.m. session? Because the presenters were a bunch of unknown master’s degree students?) was Bob Heath. Without question, I got a great introduction to the community of public relations scholars. My sense of community has only grown over the years as I had opportunities to attend more conferences, to get to know more public relations scholars, and to contribute in my turn to growing and strengthening our community. Research shows that one’s psychological sense of community can be predicted by how long one expects to be part of the community, one’s satisfaction with the community, and the number of people one knows in the community (Glynn, 1981). “Glynn also found a positive relationship between sense of community and the ability to function competently in the community” (McMillan & Chavis, 1986, p. 6). Community for public relations scholarship Guided by prior research, my personal experiences, and the precepts espoused by Kruckeberg and Starck (1988, Valentini et al., 2012), I offer here some concrete suggestions for how we might demonstrate a commitment to maintaining a sense of community among public relations scholars to the benefit of public relations scholarship: Attend conference sessions. I am sure many of us have experienced situations in which a conference session had more presenters in the room than non-presenting attendees. Having the privilege and the means to attend academic conferences comes with the responsibility of supporting the academic community with our very presence, including time-limit-respecting presentations, non-self-focused paper responses, and respectful discussions relevant to the session. Meet each other. While this is every introvert’s nightmare, meeting people face-to-face or even online can decrease one’s sense of isolation and increase one’s sense of community. I applaud the efforts by our academic associations to introduce graduate students to senior scholars and to offer mentoring opportunities to all community members, because these activities strengthen our common interests and enhance our sense of togetherness. Submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. The dissemination of research results is a standard part of the scientific method (cf. Wimmer & Dominick, 2014), and scientific journals typically have offered one means of sharing knowledge. While the oligopoly of big publishers has been appropriately scrutinized for their powerful influence on research communities (cf. Larivière, Haustein, & Mongeon, 2015a, 2015b), the reality remains that the relationship between publisher and the published is a symbiotic one, in which each party needs the other to contribute to our collective sense of community. Review manuscripts for academic journals. Academic publishing is a community project, and peer review is a function expected of competent community members. The challenges experienced by journal editors to find qualified, available, and willing manuscript reviewers are real, and the sense of professional satisfaction experienced by reviewers who take their duty seriously and execute it well is profound. So, if community is defined and created at least in part by how one feels about a group to which one belongs, then perhaps the only community that exists in reality is in fact that which is perceptual. If this is true, then the concrete actions each of us undertakes in service to each other in this community of public relations scholars are important choices indeed. Growth of public relations research networks: A bibliometric analysis Eyun-Jung Ki, Yorgo Pasadeos, and Tugce Ertem Eray present a bibliometric analysis of scholarship in public relations from a six-year publication period, beginning in 2010 and ending in 2015. First, the analysis offers insight into how scholarship in public relations has evolved over time by examining published work in the Public Relations Review, the Journal of Public Relations Research (previously the Public Relations Research Annual), and the Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly (previously the Journalism Quarterly). Second, the article expands the scope of introspective research (cf. Pavlik, 1987) on scholarly communication in public relations, by also providing an analysis of work published in three additional journals founded with the intention of being more international in perspective: International Journal of Strategic Communication, Journal of Communication Management, and Corporate Communication: An International Journal. The authors also offer strong arguments for the value of bibliometric analysis, which include illuminating not only patterns of publication and of influence, but also the status of topical areas and scholarly paradigms. Encouraging signs from the time period studied regarding the trajectory of public relations scholarship include an increase in the number of citations of refereed journal articles, as well as an increase in the number of citations of journals outside the field of public relations. I support the authors’ suggestion that existing theories in the areas of crisis communication, relationship management, new technologies, and dialogic communication might be saturated and that “[i]t might be time for researchers in these areas to bring new perspectives from which to develop new theories or frameworks” (p. x). I would also encourage continued scholarly reflection and deep thinking on ways to differentiate key terms used in our field, many of which would benefit from robust explication (cf. Chaffee, 1991). Engaged at work? An employee engagement model in public relations This important article by Hongmei Shen and Hua Jiang offers a much-needed explication of the frequently used – but unclearly defined – concept of engagement, situated in the internal context. Defining “employee engagement as the enactment and presentation of employees’ selves at work” (pp.28-45), the authors acknowledge the three dimensions of employee engagement: physical, affective, cognitive. The article offers a nomological network for employee engagement, presenting a conceptual model that examines the antecedents and outcomes of this concept, what the authors term a “strategy-engagement-behavior model” (pp.28-45). Findings from the study demonstrate the importance of organization-initiated engagement strategies: openness, networking, and assurances of legitimacy. In other words, employees feel more highly engaged with their employers when they feel the organization is open with them (e.g., about organizational decision-making processes); when the organization builds networks with professional or community groups to the benefit of employees; and when the organization acknowledges employees’ concerns as legitimate and works to address those concerns. In terms of relational outcomes, highly engaged employees not only speak well of their employers to others both inside and outside the organization, but also volunteer helpful contributions beyond what is required by their jobs (i.e., contextual performance). These results provide practical help not only to public relations practitioners in their jobs, but also to public relations scholars seeking to create more engagement at their own universities. In particular, as public relations educators and practitioners move into leadership roles in their own or other organizations, this study offers theory-driven and evidence-based suggestions for engaging employees in the workplace in ways that encourage their contextual performance and their positive information-sharing efforts. Grounding twenty-first-century public relations praxis in Aristotelian ethos Sometimes, to move forward, we have to review and remember the past, which so frequently informs the present. To that end, the article by Dominic Maximilian Ofori begins with a careful distinction between public relations practice and public relations praxis, with the former being routine and unreflective (cf. Arnett & Arneson, 1999) and the latter being not only philosophically grounded, but also thoughtfully and reflectively executed (cf. Arnett & Arneson, 1999; Roberts, 2006). The essay weaves together threads from extant literature about public relations as rhetoric and the importance of speaker (i.e., organizational) credibility in the communication process to argue that the Aristotelian notion of speaker ethos (i.e., discursive character) can help to make public relations praxis more ethically responsible. Ofori further argues that this is best done when the component elements of Aristotelian ethos – good sense or expertise (phronesis), good moral character or virtue (arête), and goodwill or shared friendship (eunoia) – are understood and explicitly connected to public relations. I find this essay to offer two important reminders. First, whether a speaker (i.e., an organization) is credible lies in the judgment (i.e., krites) of audience members, who evaluate the extent to which the rhetor’s arguments align with their own interests (i.e., eudaimonia). This means that public relations scholars must do more to collect data from both organizations and their publics when studying organizational issues and crises. Second, if public relations practitioners are truly to function as professionally independent counselors (cf. PRSA Code of Ethics, 2000), then grounding our efforts in Aristotelian ethos may indeed further the “perspectival autonomy” that Ofori argues is possible with a sophisticated understanding and execution of phronesis, arête, and eunoia. This underscores that our discipline’s journey toward professionalism remains in progress, with continuous improvements both possible and necessary.",""

By situating our study in the internal organizational context, we provided an updated conceptualization and operationalization of employee engagement, proposing a strategy-engagement-behavior three-step employee engagement model. Results from an employee survey (n = 568) supported our conceptual model, showing that organizational engagement strategies positively predicted employee engagement, which in turn accounted for employees’ positive and negative messaging behavior, as well as their contextual performance behavior. After controlling for significant demographic variables such as gender, age, organizational size, number of subordinates, and level of management position, we identified a complete mediation effect of employee engagement in our two-step structural equation modeling analysis.","engaged work employee engagement engagement emerged important concept scholarship yet theoretically informed clear coherent explication construct lacking situating internal organizational context provided updated conceptualization operationalization employee engagement proposing strategyengagementbehavior step employee engagement employee survey n = supported conceptual showing organizational engagement strategies positively predicted employee engagement turn accounted employees positive negative messaging behavior contextual performance behavior controlling demographic variables gender age organizational size number subordinates level management position identified complete mediation effect employee engagement step structural equation modeling"

This approach locates persuasion at the nexus of speaker ethos in the public relations process. It allows practitioners to balance their commitment to the ethics of their profession with loyalty to clients, while empowering audiences (organizations and their publics) to function as the final arbiters of any courses of action proposed to them. Moreover, because the approach enables practitioners, based on their credible ethos, to participate in organizational decision-making, it has the potential to transfer their ethical worldview to client organizations. Ultimately, the central theoretical contribution of this essay is an alternative approach to public relations praxis founded on an analysis of Aristotle’s notion of phronesis, arête, and eunoia.",""

Ethnocentricity characterizes much of public relations theorizing, which does not capture the broader gamut of the global enactment of public relations (Sriramesh & Vercic, 2009, 2019). This special issue aims to situate research in a non-Euro-American context and to offer richly textured, contextual understandings of public relations in the Middle East. A region steeped in history; one that gave the world its first system of writing; the cradle of three world religions; producer of a substantial share of world oil – the Middle East in recent times has gripped the world’s attention not only with issues of grave importance in conflict-ridden countries, but also with transformative economic growth, especially in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Significant political, economic, social, and cultural similarities and differences among countries in the region imply the need to examine specific contextual factors that could impact the practice of public relations in the region. The purpose of this introductory essay is to analyze and contextualize extant research in the Middle East using the global public relations framework (see Sriramesh & Vercic, 2009, 2019), introduce the articles in this issue, and to propose directions for future research. The global public relations framework considers culture fairly broadly to encompass political, economic, media, societal, organizational, and activist cultures. The framework not only highlights the importance of examining these variables, but also emphasizes the interconnections among them. This editorial introduction is structured as follows. We review the variables of the global public relations framework and contextualize public relations research in Middle Eastern countries within the framework, introduce the articles in this special issue, and suggest avenues for future research.","middle east editorial introduction origins traced ancient times regions world academic associated twentieth century united states america broom sha ethnocentricity characterizes much theorizing capture broader gamut global enactment sriramesh vercic special issue aims situate noneuroamerican context richly textured contextual understandings middle east region steeped history gave world system writing cradle world religions producer substantial share world oil middle east recent times gripped worlds attention issues grave importance conflictridden countries transformative economic growth especially countries gulf cooperation council gcc saudi arabia united arab emirates uae political economic social cultural similarities differences countries region imply need contextual factors impact practice region purpose introductory essay analyze contextualize extant middle east using global framework see sriramesh vercic introduce issue propose directions future global framework considers culture fairly broadly encompass political economic media societal organizational activist cultures framework highlights importance variables emphasizes interconnections editorial introduction structured follows review variables global framework contextualize middle eastern countries framework introduce special issue avenues future"
"180",2019,"academic_research","academic","An overview of Middle East public relations practice, education, and research from isolation to globalization Public relations has a critical role in addressing culture difference and enhancing research outreach. An analysis of practice, education and research in Middle East provides an exemplar of the need to move the discipline’s scholarship from global isolation to cultural inclusivity. A review of current scholarship in the discipline's journals documents the preeminence of “Western” theory. Research with culturally collaborative studies of media, culture, technology, and society is needed to provide global perspectives. The paper argues five initiatives are needed next steps for the discipline to achieve global inclusivity: * Enhance research collaboration – Culturally collaborative studies of media, culture, technology, and society are needed to provide global perspectives in our discipline. *Address bilingual scholarship – Public relations theory needs to acknowledge varied traditions and methodologies. Research journals need Middle Eastern faculty editorial board members and need to explore translation options. *Align research with the profession – Globally, public relations research needs qualitative understanding. Cultural differences often regress quantitative analysis to meaningless implications for both theory and practice. *Assess curriculum globalization – Educators need to increase cultural content in courses. Textbooks are needed that reflect the globalization of the field from multiple perspectives. *Develop international accreditation standards – An accreditation model based on bilingual, global, and contemporary careers in the discipline is needed. International accreditation site teams must include bilingual members.","overview middle east practice education isolation globalization critical role addressing culture difference enhancing outreach practice education middle east exemplar need move disciplines scholarship global isolation cultural inclusivity review current scholarship disciplines journals documents preeminence western culturally collaborative media culture technology society needed global perspectives argues initiatives needed next steps discipline achieve global inclusivity enhance collaboration culturally collaborative media culture technology society needed global perspectives discipline address bilingual scholarship needs acknowledge varied traditions methodologies journals need middle eastern faculty editorial board members need translation options align profession globally needs qualitative cultural differences regress quantitative meaningless practice assess curriculum globalization educators need increase cultural content courses textbooks needed reflect globalization field multiple perspectives develop international accreditation standards accreditation bilingual global contemporary careers discipline needed international accreditation site teams must include bilingual members"

This study has both empirical and methodological objectives: a) to solve a built-in lacuna in on-going dialogue research that frequently addresses important aspects of PR and dialogue in a blended manner, thereby undercutting the ability to develop in-depth critical research and examine the issues of dialogue more comprehensively; b) to provide an empirical contribution to understanding dialogue within the context of political NGOs’ public relations in Israel’s divided society. We suggest a layered approach as a methodological solution to this void by introducing a Strata Approach to Dialogue Analysis (SADA). Israel’s divided society, comprising various opposing groups, serves as a case study to demonstrate the advantages of SADA over current analyzes of dialogue. By revealing the differences between dialogic potential (features), actual dialogue (process), and the perception of dialogue (orientation), SADA enables the development of in-depth, critical research, i.e. examining the issue of dialogue more accurately and comprehensively.","introducing strata dialogue sada case political ngos israel dialogue flourishing past decades critics contend scholarship misses core philosophical idea dialogue focusing instead absence presence dialogic principles organizational settings empirical methodological objectives solve built lacuna going dialogue frequently addresses important aspects pr dialogue blended manner thereby undercutting ability develop depth critical issues dialogue comprehensively b empirical contribution dialogue context political ngos israels divided society layered methodological solution void introducing strata dialogue sada israels divided society comprising opposing groups serves case demonstrate advantages sada current analyzes dialogue revealing differences dialogic potential features actual dialogue process perception dialogue orientation sada enables development depth critical e issue dialogue accurately comprehensively"

Drawing from two complementary approaches (relationship management and human resources management perspectives), the current study proposed a model of employee turnover intention as the ultimate negative outcome of the relationship quality that employees perceive to have developed with their organization, which is predicted by perceptions of organizational justice. Additionally, the current study incorporated employee job engagement as the mediator connecting the EOR with the turnover intention. The results of an in-person survey of 438 salespeople for a South Korean company revealed that organizational justice perceptions had a significant and direct influence on the EOR quality.

This is particularly relevant for public relations today, as digital activism almost ubiquitously involves bringing together conflicting publics who are active and social media-savvy, meanwhile maintaining an organizational brand/mission. Using the 2017 Women’s March on Washington (WMW) as an object of study, we explored how campaign messages reflected principles of intersectionality, consensus- and dissensus-based communication, and organizational self-reflection. We conducted a thematic analysis of posts from the WMW’s social media accounts as well as media quotes by the organizational leaders to get at the leaders’ intentions in their message design. Data suggested that messages of inclusivity as well as of necessary discord were employed to enact political change for WMW’s publics. We argue that although the WMW was not wholly intersectional, particularly in determining its political agenda, the efforts toward intersectionality are notable for theory-building and reflective practice, particularly for social mediated campaigns. The study proposes a theory for digital intersectional communication to guide future research and advocacy work.","problem intersectionality digital activism womens march washingtons attempt unite women convergence activism intersectionality communicators create messages social justice issues using social media particularly relevant today digital activism almost ubiquitously involves bringing together conflicting publics active social mediasavvy meanwhile maintaining organizational brandmission using womens march washington wmw object explored campaign messages reflected principles intersectionality consensus dissensus communication organizational selfreflection conducted thematic posts wmws social media accounts media quotes organizational leaders get leaders intentions message design data suggested messages inclusivity necessary discord employed enact political change wmws publics argue wmw wholly intersectional particularly determining political agenda efforts intersectionality notable building reflective practice particularly social mediated campaigns proposes digital intersectional communication guide future advocacy work"

A pilot study and a 3 (issues) x 2 (organizational affirmation) x 2 (organizational type) between-subjects experiment were conducted. Results suggest that issues have different capacities to trigger the salience of identities. A person’s overall identity salience and an organization’s affirmation on the issue significantly affect individuals’ perception of the organization as an ingroup (POI) and their identity expression, where POI plays a mediating role. Results of this study show a promising path to theorizing issues as contexts for identity contentions and organization-public relationships as identity connections. Results also suggest that individuals build connections with organizations to serve their self-definitional and self-enhancement needs. This identity-based view not only narrows the gap between segmentation approaches to publics and relationship research, but also points to the reason why individuals have connections to certain organizations – to validate and express their salient identities.","issues identity salience individual sense connection organizations identity identity framework social identity selfcategorization proposes identity organizationpublic relationships pilot issues x organizational affirmation x organizational subjects experiment conducted issues capacities trigger salience identities persons overall identity salience organizations affirmation issue significantly affect individuals perception organization ingroup poi identity expression poi plays mediating role promising path theorizing issues contexts identity contentions organizationpublic relationships identity connections individuals build connections organizations serve selfdefinitional selfenhancement needs identity view narrows gap segmentation publics relationship points reason individuals connections certain organizations validate express salient identities"

By tracking the stances of each corporation and its activists longitudinally through content analysis, results generate the occurrence and changes of relationship modes over time. Findings show that COPR is equally applicable in both resolved and unresolved U.S. conflicts. Regardless of whether the problems were resolved or not, competing relationships occurred more frequently than cooperating relationships, which strengthens the argument that both parties maintain competing relationships for self-interests and may adopt strategies to achieve mutual benefits as well.

Since the spill, the corporate image of BP has been severely challenged. The company has used many strategies to preserve and restore the corporate image, and has sought means to mitigate the intensity of the ongoing threat to individuals, businesses, and a delicate ecosystem. Among these means are interacting with individuals and interest groups through social media channels. Benoit's (1995) theory of image restoration discourse posits various strategies corporations use to restore their image during a crisis. The BP crisis presents an opportunity to extend the theories of image restoration to the realm of social media. Results of a content analysis showed that corrective action was the dominant image restoration strategy employed by BP in their Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Flickr pages.

These orientations include commitment to religion, devotion to the group, resistance to change/attachment to history and recognition of hierarchal order. Based on an initial review of these orientations, the study identifies guiding principles exhorting practitioners to carefully consider the nature, function and purpose of public relations practice in the Arab world and the relationship among cultural value orientations.

"242",2011,"academic_review","academic","Differences between the public and private communication of rumors. A pilot survey in Belgium Liu et al. (2010) and Gelders et al. (2007) called for evidence-based research on differences between public and private sector communication. This article offers such data by focusing on an increasingly important domain of public relations (i.e., corporate communication about rumors vis-à-vis internal and external stakeholders). Our results show government communicators are more frequently confronted with harmful rumors than business communicators but a similar number of respondents from each group have experienced the listed effects and these respondents rate the effects as equally severe. However, fewer public sector communicators have applied most of the proposed strategies, and those who did found them to be in most cases less effective than private sector respondents. In other words, government communicators hear more rumors, experience equally often the negative effects and find them equally severe as business communicators, but they often do not react to them and if they do, they do not find the strategies to be very effective. This study suggests that typical features of public sector organizations, such as the capricious political climate and the influence of party politics, might offer an explanation for these findings.",""

And yet in both cases, from the beginning, each safeguarded his position and managed to keep a significant percentage of the public opinion on his side. This paper argues that although the image restoration strategies of Berlusconi and Clinton were substantially different in content and form, they were both appropiate in their cultural contexts. A cross-cultural examination of the cultural dynamics of these two distinct nations shows that the effectiveness of image restoration strategies can vary greatly according to cultural, political and media variables of each country.","sex scandals crosscultural image repair strategies cases bill clinton silvio berlusconi former president united states bill clinton current prime minister italy silvio berlusconi things common save involved highly publicized sex scandals respective mandates yet cases beginning safeguarded position managed keep percentage public opinion side argues image restoration strategies berlusconi clinton substantially content form appropiate cultural contexts crosscultural examination cultural dynamics distinct nations shows effectiveness image restoration strategies vary greatly according cultural political media variables country"

This outlook of occupational psyche casts a shadow over the bright prospect for media recognition of the profession. Journalists’ problems operate outside media relations, thus beyond direct attempts of public relations practitioners at media recognition via enhancing professionalism in their practices. There have been, however, only a few qualitative studies on this significant issue, all pointing to journalists’ occupational psyche running against media recognition. The purpose of this study is to determine quantitatively whether journalists’ own job satisfaction and their envy of public relations practitioners lead to their negative attitude. A survey of 128 Korean off-line journalists was conducted, and its results suggested that occupational psyche has little influence on media attitude—contrary to the findings of previous qualitative studies. For future study, this paper issues a call for cross-country, comparative research on the subject of journalists’ occupational psyche.","journalists problems aggravating hostility korean journalists journalists job problems detrimental media recognition journalists vent frustration worsening job conditions practitioners outlook occupational psyche casts shadow bright prospect media recognition profession journalists problems operate outside media relations thus beyond direct attempts practitioners media recognition via enhancing professionalism practices qualitative issue pointing journalists occupational psyche running media recognition purpose determine quantitatively journalists job satisfaction envy practitioners lead negative attitude survey korean line journalists conducted suggested occupational psyche little influence media attitudecontrary previous qualitative future issues call crosscountry comparative subject journalists occupational psyche"

In public relations practice, however, ROI appears to be used in a much looser form to indicate the results of activity. This quantitative research using an online survey instrument investigated practitioner understanding of the term, primarily in the UK, with the aim of preparing a benchmark on their understanding of the ROI concept and usage of ROI as a measurement of the effectiveness of public relations activity. These findings resulted: (1) two-thirds of PR practitioners regularly use the term ROI when planning and evaluating communication activity; (2) ROI is related mainly to communication objectives (66.7%) which are more widely used than financially related ROIs (12.8%); (3) there is a clear difference in ROI practices between consultants/freelances and in-house colleagues. Nearly three-quarters of consultants and freelances (73.1%) offered an ROI formula to clients but only 26.3% of in-house practitioners have one; and (4) on the oft-discussed question of an industry-wide ROI formula, only 35.6% supported the proposition with 64.4% opposed. The survey also found that practitioner concepts of ROI are very narrowly expressed, mainly in relation to media outputs.","initial investigation use return investment practice return investment roi usually defined management marketing measure financial effectiveness concerned returns capital employed business profitmaking activities practice roi appears used much looser form activity quantitative using online survey instrument investigated practitioner term primarily uk aim preparing benchmark roi concept usage roi measurement effectiveness activity resulted thirds pr practitioners regularly use term roi planning evaluating communication activity roi mainly communication objectives widely used financially rois clear difference roi practices consultantsfreelances house colleagues nearly quarters consultants freelances offered roi formula clients house practitioners oft question industrywide roi formula supported proposition opposed survey practitioner concepts roi narrowly expressed mainly relation media outputs"

China's signing (in 2003) and ratifying (in 2005) the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) place it in a position to adopt some of the anti-smoking measures common in some developed nations. Even though the country's tobacco industry acknowledges publicly health concerns over its products, it engages in communication practices that are paradoxical, in that they circumvent public-health initiatives and the expanding regulatory regimes of product-risk reduction even as the government promotes tobacco use. That paradox calls for three public-policymaking proposals: to conduct more comprehensive, nationwide health-communication campaigns; to use legislation to reduce tobacco use; and to restructure the tobacco industry.","chinas tobacco industrys communication practices paradoxes proposals public policymaking peoples republic chinas expanding tobaccocontrol efforts call additional urgent government action major fronts conducting comprehensive healthcommunication campaigns clinical economic effects tobacco use b requiring major policy changes structural administrative relationships state tobacco monopoly administration stma industry large primarily china national tobacco company cntc chinas signing ratifying world health organization framework convention tobacco control fctc place position adopt antismoking measures common developed nations though countrys tobacco industry acknowledges publicly health concerns products engages communication practices paradoxical circumvent publichealth initiatives expanding regulatory regimes productrisk reduction government promotes tobacco use paradox calls publicpolicymaking proposals conduct comprehensive nationwide healthcommunication campaigns use legislation reduce tobacco use restructure tobacco industry"

An impending rockslide is expected to produce a tsunami in the fjord around Åknes in Norway. Waves may run up above sea level as high as 82 m or 269 ft. All residents (18 and older) of the four most threatened communities received a questionnaire to determine what they perceived to be useful risk information. Three hundred and eighty-two (43.6% of 875) responded. Results indicated that parents of children living within the tsunami risk zones perceived the risk information to be the most useful. Those who lived in communities that experienced a similar disaster in 1934 reported public meetings less useful than written or mediated information. Publics who lived in communities with such disaster history and those who were not parents posed special challenges in risk communication because they perceived information from the government agencies as lacking in usefulness. Therefore, committing the resources necessary to foster dialogues with a diversity of publics exposed to risk would be well served to fully understand the nature of risk communication responses, and to be able to save human lives.",""

In other regions of the world, for example in Latin America, historical developments and social understandings have led to slightly different conceptualizations of PR and journalism. Using Chile as a case study, this paper reports the results of an examination of Chilean journalists’ and PR practitioners’ professional conceptions. While both groups tend to have somewhat similar views of media relations and see themselves as part of the same profession, there are also important differences which are most likely based on professional socialization processes rather than educational backgrounds or sociodemographic and work related variables.

The second area considers how knowledge management and project management findings confirm the value of teaching as the cocreation of knowledge. The third draws parallels between the challenges of moving from traditional to future management and moving from traditional to future education.

Still, with all the importance placed on experiential-learning experiences for public relations, journalism, and mass communication students, scant literature exists on the subject. Much of the literature is anecdotal or descriptive in nature. Few studies address the underlying feelings and expectations of the two major participants in the internship process: students and their site supervisors. This study focused on this interrelationship as a means of understanding underlying expectations so that internship experiences can be improved. In order to understand the underlying expectations and perspectives of the internship experience for the two groups of participants – 223 public relations interns and 183 of their site supervisors – a phenomenological method of inquiry was used.

By building on a more advanced understanding of communication as process of social meaning construction that is embedded in networks of differential relations between different actors, it contributes to extend the perspective of first- and second-order agenda building towards a kind of “third order” or “network agenda building”. Via an automated content analysis of more than 3700 articles we examine agenda- and frame-differences between public relations, UK and US news in the BP crisis. The study documents that BP successfully applied a decoupling strategy: It dissociated itself from being responsible for the cause and at the same time presented itself as solvent of the crisis.

Surveys were completed by 313 respondents to measure their relationships with all three organizational types. Significant differences were detected between organizations which were deemed high, medium and low in communality. Results provide insight into the role that communality plays in levels of relationship quality in the organization–public relationship.","advancing relationship management mapping continuum relationship building relationship management way organization influences nature organizationpublic relationship organizationpublic relationship nonprofit organizationvolunteer retailerconsumer political partymember mapped hungs continuum relationships ranging communal exploitive dimensions relationship trust control mutuality satisfaction commitment surveys completed respondents measure relationships organizational differences detected organizations deemed high medium low communality insight role communality plays levels relationship quality organizationpublic relationship"

The case study includes interviews with members of the emergency department's (ED) dominant coalition and focus groups with ED staff, as well as field observations in the ED itself. Findings illustrate that structural and policy antecedents acted as barriers to relationship maintenance, that a reliance on asymmetrical cultivation strategies culminated in poor internal OPRs, and that these poor relationships fostered negative attitudes, non-compliant behavior, and an arguably toxic organizational culture. Also, there was some evidence of symmetrical cultivation strategies (e.g., positivity and networking) fostering positive OPR perceptions among some employees. This case study can be used to guide best practices in internal public relations and answers the call for more research on public relations and health communication. Moreover, the current study suggests avenues for extending the relationship management perspective by considering organizational culture as a possible outcome of internal relationships.","pr er managing internal organizationpublic relationships hospital emergency department focusing universityaffiliated emergency department case investigates antecedents outcomes internal organizationpublic relationships cultivation strategies used manage internal organizationpublic relationships oprs case includes interviews members emergency departments ed dominant coalition focus groups ed staff field observations ed illustrate structural policy antecedents acted barriers relationship maintenance reliance asymmetrical cultivation strategies culminated poor internal oprs poor relationships fostered negative attitudes noncompliant behavior arguably toxic organizational culture evidence symmetrical cultivation strategies eg positivity networking fostering positive opr perceptions employees case used guide best practices internal answers call health communication moreover current avenues extending relationship management perspective considering organizational culture possible outcome internal relationships"

The corporation under study is Kao Corporation, which is one of the largest Japanese consumer and industrial goods manufacturers. Information was collected from interviewing a PR manager of Kao Corporation. Evidence suggests that Kao's PR department functions more or less like an advertising department. Press releases are placed in the media as paid advertisements. Kao's PR uses a third-party endorsement to establish a new product's credibility. The company has a participative corporate culture that allows the PR director to work closely with the top management. The idea of collaborative efforts between departments and the practice of being a socially responsible company suggest that Kao's PR department uses a combination of communication models and Japanese management styles to project a good corporate citizen image.","functions perspective japanese corporation pr functions large japanese corporation pr role management function corporation kao corporation largest japanese consumer industrial goods manufacturers information collected interviewing pr manager kao corporation evidence kaos pr department functions like advertising department press releases placed media paid advertisements kaos pr uses thirdparty endorsement establish new products credibility company participative corporate culture allows pr director work closely top management idea collaborative efforts departments practice socially responsible company kaos pr department uses combination communication models japanese management styles project good corporate citizen image"

Public relations and CSR leadership in India Public relations scholars have argued that public relations practitioners, as boundary spanners between organizations and their diverse publics, are well positioned to assume leadership and become the “conscience” of their organization's CSR efforts. Conversely, scholars have also questioned public relations practitioners’ assumption of leadership of CSR. Much of the debate, both for and against, has been generated in Euro/American contexts of practice. As part of a larger study, this research aimed to examine whether the argument for public relations’ leadership of CSR holds true in non-Western contexts as well, specifically, by examining CSR leadership in corporations in India that are known to be socially responsible. This study found that in the majority of companies that are heavily engaged in CSR in India, it was the senior business executives and managers, instead of the PR practitioners, that were tasked with CSR leadership. Based on the findings of this study, this paper questions the assumption of CSR leadership by public relations practitioners.","better stay single csr leadership india scholars argued practitioners boundary spanners organizations diverse publics positioned assume leadership become conscience organizations csr efforts conversely scholars questioned practitioners assumption leadership csr much debate generated euroamerican contexts practice larger aimed argument leadership csr holds true nonwestern contexts csr leadership corporations india known socially responsible majority companies heavily engaged csr india senior business executives managers instead pr practitioners tasked csr leadership questions assumption csr leadership practitioners"

If journal impact factors accurately differentiate journals along a quality continuum, journals with higher impact factors should be referenced more often than journals with lower impact factors as sources of influence on scholars’ conceptual and methodological approaches to inquiry. To investigate this claim, a sample consisting of all twelve issues of Human Communication Research (HCR) and Communication Monographs (CM) published from 2007 through 2009 were content analyzed and every citation to either journal in the articles appearing in HCR and CM was coded.

Dynamics of social change and the social construction of reality lie at the root of both contemporary security problems and of a clear understanding of the role of strategic communications in resolving them. Success in the current environment is not defined by military victory but by building peaceful social orders, and defeating opponents in the psychological and sociological domain. To understand the role of strategic communications in this new security environment requires an alternative paradigm of sufficient coherence to replace, or supplement, the traditional state-centered security paradigm. We argue that using social change as an alternative paradigm, framed around the theoretical vocabulary of the social construction of reality, generates insights into the role of strategic communications in supporting foreign policy and national security objectives. These are explored in eight lessons learned from our experience of implementing communications for social change in conflict environments.","shaping zeitgeist influencing social processes center gravity strategic communications twenty century face new dynamics world new problems dynamics social change social construction reality lie root contemporary security problems clear role strategic communications resolving success current environment defined military victory building peaceful social orders defeating opponents psychological sociological domain role strategic communications new security environment requires alternative paradigm sufficient coherence replace supplement traditional statecentered security paradigm argue using social change alternative paradigm framed around vocabulary social construction reality generates insights role strategic communications supporting foreign policy national security objectives explored eight lessons learned experience implementing communications social change conflict environments"

Therefore western allies in Iraq and Afghanistan are not only involved in a physical struggle but also in a struggle over perceptions, for no long-term engagement of troops is possible without support from home, nor can a counterinsurgency succeed without the support of the local population. While the ability to exert influence upon various relevant target groups – opponents, the local population and the home front – has always been crucially important during conflicts, with the more recent globalized media this has led to previously unknown potential opportunities to influence audiences. With the intermixing of target audiences and the successes achieved by terrorists in the field of communication, the importance of the ideological struggle has increased enormously. In this context the concept of strategic communication has become relevant, which refers to the consistency of strategy, activities, themes and messages, and the aim of obtaining legitimacy and support. The heart of a strategic communication strategy is formed by a strategic narrative, a compelling storyline which can explain events convincingly and from which inferences can be drawn.

The leadership requirement to define a new reality when guiding transition and complex change is identified. Three reality-defining truths are drawn from the convergence of leadership and communication theories. First, it is not possible to lead without communicating. Second, it is not possible to not communicate. Third, it is not possible to communicate without influencing others. Analysis of current DoD lexicon, principles and organizational design related to communication activities reveals a technical/monologic mindset. This mindset is evaluated based on the three truths, shortfalls of the mindset are identified, and four concrete leadership actions are proposed to guide a transition to a social/dialogic mindset. Proposed actions include defining a new vision and purpose for the military based on preservation of credibility and trust, creation of a new communication lexicon, creation of universal guiding principles, and revision of doctrine and training to incorporate social-communication thought, theory and practice.","fourth estate dead long live fourth estate new military mindset rapidly evolving communication environment identify need shift communication mindset us department defense dod better account speed ubiquity mobility human interaction evolving communication environment leadership requirement define new reality guiding transition complex change identified realitydefining truths drawn convergence leadership communication possible lead without communicating second possible communicate third possible communicate without influencing others current dod lexicon principles organizational design communication activities reveals technicalmonologic mindset mindset evaluated truths shortfalls mindset identified concrete leadership actions proposed guide transition socialdialogic mindset proposed actions include defining new vision purpose military preservation credibility trust creation new communication lexicon creation universal guiding principles revision doctrine training incorporate socialcommunication thought practice"

This paper analyzes the effect of the Spanish government's messaging in the face of the Madrid bombing of March 11, 2004: unlike what happened with the 9/11 bombings in the USA and the 7/07 London attacks, the Spanish media did not support the government's framing of the events. Taking framing as a strategic action in a discursive form (Pan & Kosicki, 2003), and in the context of the attribution theory of responsibilities, this research uses the “cascading activation” model (Entman, 2003, Entman, 2004) to explore how a framing contest was generated in the press. Analysis of the coverage shows that the intended government frame triggered a battle among the different major newspapers, leading editorials to shift their frame over the four days prior to the national elections. This research analyzes strategic contests in framing processes and contributes insight into the interactions among the different sides (government, parties, media, and citizens) to help bring about an understanding of the rebuttal effect of the government's intended frame. It also helps to develop an understanding of the role of the media and the influence of citizens’ frames on media content.","communicating strategically face terrorism spanish governments response madrid bombing attacks reemergence insurgency tied terrorism governments need strategically manage communications analyzes effect spanish governments messaging face madrid bombing march unlike happened bombings usa london attacks spanish media support governments framing events taking framing strategic action discursive form pan kosicki context attribution responsibilities uses cascading activation entman entman framing contest generated press coverage shows intended government frame triggered battle major newspapers leading editorials shift frame days prior national elections analyzes strategic contests framing processes contributes insight interactions sides government parties media citizens help bring rebuttal effect governments intended frame helps develop role media influence citizens frames media content"

As change projects depend on implementation by executives and employees, change communications is a form of (internal) strategic stakeholder management. Change communications can be identified as the single part of change management, which focuses on the soft factors that are activated through the change of hard factors.

The present paper discusses internal communication in the global context, with a focus on language as an issue for the organization. Although ‘language’, naturally, is a resource that enables any – internal or other – communication, it has not been examined in public relations research but has been taken for granted or as given. The current pace of globalization in all sectors has rapidly globalized internal communication and the language issue needs to be addressed. On the basis of two empirical studies we discuss language strategy and language use in international internal communication. Our findings show that although a common ‘corporate language’ – which mostly today refers to English – enables internal communication, it is not a straightforward solution but a number of issues need to be considered. For example, as international communication in a business context is today mostly conducted by non-native speakers of English, their language can be characterized as BELF (English as Business Lingua Franca), which differs from ‘standard English’ in many ways. Also, language issues need to be considered for organizational credibility and knowledge sharing and for constructing trust and rapport in international interaction.","language issue international internal communication english local language english english present discusses internal communication global context focus language issue organization language naturally resource enables internal communication taken granted given current pace globalization sectors rapidly globalized internal communication language issue needs addressed basis empirical discuss language strategy language use international internal communication common corporate language mostly today refers english enables internal communication straightforward solution number issues need considered example international communication business context today mostly conducted nonnative speakers english language characterized belf english business lingua franca differs standard english ways language issues need considered organizational credibility knowledge sharing constructing trust rapport international interaction"

The survey was conducted among the 367 largest private companies (selected from DK 1000, established by Børsen business magasin) and among 98 public organizations (municipalities). The overall goal was to get a preliminary idea of how these companies or organizations perceive, plan, coordinate and implement internal crisis management and crisis communication activities before, during and after a crisis. The survey questionnaire comprised 36 questions and was sent to respondents who typically are responsible for the crisis-preparedness of their organizations. The results from the survey show that the vast majority of organizations have a crisis or contingency plan, and most of these plans contain an internal dimension relating to the management and communication with the internal stakeholders during a crisis. Thus, the study shows a rather professional and formalized behavior towards crisis management in general, but also when it comes to managing a crisis in relation to the internal organizational stakeholders in specific. In addition, the results clearly indicate a strong relation between organizational size and crisis management; the larger the organization the more likely to have a crisis plan. This particularly pertained to the private organizations. The ICMCC survey forms part of a major collaborative research project, financed by the Danish Council for Independent Research/Social Sciences (2011–2014), entitled Internal Crisis Management and Crisis Communication in Danish Organizations. The purpose of this three-year long project is to shed light upon the role of internal crisis management and crisis communication before, during and after an organizational crisis and/or a societal crisis leading to downsizing or major changes within an organization or an organizational field.",""

In particular, we find evidence to support the proposition that employee orientation contributes more to corporate financial performance (CFP) than orientation towards any other individual primary stakeholder group, including customers, communities, suppliers and shareholders. These findings have practical implications for corporate level strategy and the prioritization of budgetary resources by communication managers.

Kent and Taylor proposed five dialogic principles for mediated public relations in 1998 and numerous studies of activist groups, corporations, and educational institutions have shown that most websites fail to meet their dialogic potential. This study explores some of the reasons why activist organizations do not integrate dialogic features into their websites. Thirteen activist public relations practitioners were interviewed to determine their perceptions of websites as tools for information dissemination and resource mobilization. Three consistent themes emerged from the interviews: (1) website communication is perceived to be most effective when tied to issue-specific events and issue currency, (2) websites cater to existing and highly involved publics, and (3) websites are viewed as passive communication tools that must be supplemented with traditional public relations practices.","activist practitioner perspectives website activist websites fulfilling dialogic promise kent taylor proposed dialogic principles mediated numerous activist groups corporations educational institutions shown websites fail meet dialogic potential reasons activist organizations integrate dialogic features websites thirteen activist practitioners interviewed determine perceptions websites tools information dissemination resource mobilization consistent themes emerged interviews website communication perceived effective tied issue events issue currency websites cater existing highly involved publics websites viewed passive communication tools must supplemented traditional practices"

This paper looks into how 73 nonprofit organizations use Twitter to engage stakeholders not only through their tweets, but also through other various communication methods. Specifically it looks into the organizations utilization of tweet frequency, following behavior, hyperlinks, hashtags, public messages, retweets, and multimedia files. After analyzing 4655 tweets, the study found that the nation's largest nonprofits are not using Twitter to maximize stakeholder involvement. Instead, they continue to use social media as a one-way communication channel as less than 20% of their total tweets demonstrate conversations and roughly 16% demonstrate indirect connections to specific users.","engaging stakeholders twitter nonprofit organizations getting characters seem difficult communicate meaningful manner characters twitter users creative ways get tweet using communication tools looks nonprofit organizations use twitter engage stakeholders tweets communication methods looks organizations utilization tweet frequency following behavior hyperlinks hashtags public messages retweets multimedia files analyzing tweets nations largest nonprofits using twitter maximize stakeholder involvement instead continue use social media way communication channel total tweets demonstrate conversations roughly demonstrate indirect connections users"

With the declining economy and limited access to resources, it is important to know how organizations utilize Web-based tools to build and maintain relationships at national and global levels. Because prior research found that users had negative feelings about lack of dialogue on college websites, it is also important to know whether universities are tapping into the dialogic potential. The content analyses of the websites and Facebook platforms show that more than half of the universities have Facebook pages.

The dominant corporate-centric view of U.S. public relations history often claim that public relations developed as a response to activists who attempted to interfere with business operations. That myopic, corporate-centric view has perpetuated a negative view of public relations as merely a tool of “big business”. In the past as well as the present, corporations have been learning from and co-opting activists’ innovative public relations techniques.

It is generally considered to have emerged after 1990, although publicity and political propaganda preceded it (Rogojinaru in Sriramesh and Verčič, 2009, p. 553). Although the Romanian practice of public relations evolved and developed quickly aligning with the international practice, several campaigns and programs receiving awards during the last editions of IPRA Golden World Awards, SABRE Awards, Cannes Lions Awards or European Excellence Awards, there is still very little focus on research and theory. Thus, there is no major study on the history of public relations in Romania prior to 1989 to either confirm or challenge the conclusion of Grunig, Grunig and Verčič (2004) that there was no public relations in Eastern Europe before 1989 because the concept was not acceptable for socialism (p. 137). Even after 1989 while there is a growing body of literature on public relations in general published in Romanian, few studies addressed Romanian public relations which are more frequently described in practice than researched from the viewpoint of public relations theory. This exploratory research aims at identifying the characteristics of government public relations in Romania in 2011, the main stages in institutionalizing government public relations after 1989 and correlates them with the general evolution of public relations in Romania between 1989 and 2011.",""

On 19th January 2004, the UK government published An Independent Review of Government Communications (Phillis, 2004) known as the Phillis Review, and announced that it would implement the recommendations in full. In the early 2000s, under the Government of the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, there was some blurring of the lines between the role of impartial government communicators who were members of the Government Information and Communication Service (GICS) and politically appointed Special Advisors. In 1997, Alistair Campbell, Director of Communication, and Blair's Special Advisor, had been given the power to direct government communicators and subsequently there were a number of incidents that reinforced the view that propriety lines were being breached. It was felt that the GICS was being increasingly politicised. The Phillis Review led to far reaching change, the most important being the appointment of a Permanent Secretary, a civil servant of the most senior rank to lead GICS. The impact on the GICS was significant. It re-established its independence from political advisors, its numbers increased and it found a renewed confidence and role in Government and public life. This apparent progress came to an abrupt halt in 2010. As part of its austerity measures to address the budget deficit, Government spending on communications was frozen and in January 2011, Matt Tee, the incumbent Permanent Secretary was made redundant and left Government service in March 2011. In June and December 2011, the Government made announcements that there would be far reaching changes to Government communications which will be implemented by the Spring of 2012. This includes the appointment of a civil servant of lesser grade to head the service. So, what does this mean for Government communications? This paper reflects on the changes in Government communications in the first decade of the 21st century and concludes that in many ways it has come full circle – history is in danger of repeating itself.","uk government communications full circle century january uk government published independent review government communications phillis known phillis review announced implement recommendations full early government prime minister tony blair blurring lines role impartial government communicators members government information communication service gics politically appointed special advisors alistair campbell director communication blairs special advisor given power direct government communicators subsequently number incidents reinforced view propriety lines breached felt gics increasingly politicised phillis review led far reaching change important appointment permanent secretary civil servant senior rank lead gics impact gics reestablished independence political advisors numbers increased renewed confidence role government public life apparent progress came abrupt halt austerity measures address budget deficit government spending communications frozen january matt tee incumbent permanent secretary made redundant left government service march june december government made announcements far reaching changes government communications implemented spring includes appointment civil servant lesser grade head service mean government communications reflects changes government communications decade century concludes ways come full circle history danger repeating"

The past 50 years of crisis management highlight key shifts in crisis practice, creating opportunities for multiple theories and research tracks. Defining crises such as Tylenol, Exxon Valdez, and September 11 terrorist attacks have influenced or challenged the principles of best practice of crisis communication in public relations. This study traces the development of crisis process and practice by identifying shifts in crisis research and models and mapping these against key management theories and practices. The findings define three crisis domains: crisis planning, building and testing predictive models, and mapping and measuring external environmental influences.

In the first half of the 20th century, there were two research methods applied, opinion polls and basic media analysis. These were used to plan campaigns and monitor progress of media relations activities. In the second half of the century, as the practices of public relations expanded, greater emphasis was given to media analysis but the evidence of many practitioner studies was that measurement and evaluation was more discussed than undertaken. In the final 25 years of the century, the academic voice began to become more prominent in the discussion and development of methodologies and in nationally-based education programmes aimed at practitioners. The Internet and social media also began to change practices. There were mixed results from this clamour: more practitioners began to evaluate public relations activity (but many still applied discredited measures) whilst new techniques began to be introduced. Document analysis has prepared a timeline of the development of public relations measurement and evaluation. This paper explores the academic and professional themes that have characterised the development of this important public relations practice over the past 110 years.","evolution measurement evaluation measurement evaluation effectiveness long major professional issue half century methods applied opinion polls basic media used plan campaigns monitor progress media relations activities second half century practices expanded greater emphasis given media evidence practitioner measurement evaluation undertaken final years century academic voice began become prominent discussion development methodologies nationally education programmes aimed practitioners internet social media began change practices mixed clamour practitioners began evaluate activity applied discredited measures whilst new techniques began introduced document prepared timeline development measurement evaluation academic professional themes characterised development important practice past years"

Opportunities for public relations to offer a career rather than simply a transitory job or occupation were identified. The potential for enhanced benefits, including greater income and higher social status, were noted as a result. However, despite evidence of the possibility of professional and bureaucratic career paths, public relations pioneers tended to reflect entrepreneurial, opportunistic and primarily commenda (agency) forms of career. Most early practitioners entered the field by chance revealing a lack of deliberate focus on seeking employment in the occupation. Their varying entry points suggest the concept of equifinality (whereby different routes may lead to the same end); although career progression for those employed in public relations support functions, and the experiences of women are largely undocumented. Overall, the tapestry of early careers in public relations reflects a common thread of communications and openness to take advantage of the changing times. Otherwise, few patterns can be detected, with individual opportunities than a specific career path being the dominant theme.","origins careers origins careers seeks contribute towards historical knowledge content biographies published narratives worked field us britain formative years opportunities career simply transitory job occupation identified potential enhanced benefits greater income higher social status noted result despite evidence possibility professional bureaucratic career paths pioneers tended reflect entrepreneurial opportunistic primarily commenda agency forms career early practitioners entered field chance revealing lack deliberate focus seeking employment occupation varying entry points concept equifinality whereby routes lead end career progression employed support functions experiences women largely undocumented overall tapestry early careers reflects common thread communications openness take advantage changing times otherwise patterns detected individual opportunities career path dominant theme"

However, the understanding of how publics cope with and interpret crises is crucial for developing the body of knowledge in crisis communication, from both critical and managerial/functionalist perspectives. This case study of the Love Parade crisis in Germany 2010 aimed at exploring how publics perceived the crisis response of the festival organizers and how they used social media to communicate about it shortly after the outbreak of the crisis. A content analysis of 1847 postings at two relevant message boards produced support for the assumption that attributions of cause and responsibility are important predictors of publics’ evaluations of organizations in crisis situations. Findings also revealed that stakeholders actively engage in such attributional inferences spontaneously without being prompted by researchers. The analysis of responsibility perceptions as well as evaluative judgments over time supported the situational crisis communication theory. Blaming others and denying responsibility in the context of a crisis that was perceived as human error accident triggered negative reputational outcomes for the organizations involved in the Love Parade.","publics use social media respond blame games crisis communication love parade tragedy duisburg crisis communication scholarship criticized managerial bias tendency marginalize perspective publics audiences publics cope interpret crises crucial developing body knowledge crisis communication critical managerialfunctionalist perspectives case love parade crisis germany aimed publics perceived crisis response festival organizers used social media communicate shortly outbreak crisis content postings relevant message boards produced support assumption attributions cause responsibility important predictors publics evaluations organizations crisis situations stakeholders actively engage attributional inferences spontaneously without prompted researchers responsibility perceptions evaluative judgments time supported situational crisis communication blaming others denying responsibility context crisis perceived human error accident triggered negative reputational outcomes organizations involved love parade"

Yet, even if the question of access were resolved, there still remains the question of external validity, i.e., the issue of whether and to what extent the membership of PRSA (or any other sampling frame) reflects the population of public relations practitioners in general.

"364",2012,"academic_review","academic","Toward an ethnographic imperative in public relations research A central goal in social science research is developing descriptive and causal inferences from observable data (King, Keohane, & Verba, 1994). Following this perspective, we propose ethnography as a methodological imperative in public relations research that seeks to develop descriptive inferences about the influence of an organization's culture on its social ecology. The ethnographic imperative in research design is derived from two interlocked, epistemological commitments in research design. First, a view that the culture of an organization is constituted as a system of shared knowledge that is socially transmitted over time among organizational members. Second, as a consequence, the cognitive setting for actor-based models of organizational social relationships and imperatives is cultural in nature. Based on these commitments, ethnography as a methodological imperative is specifically enjoined when research derived from cocreational public relations theories is explicitly set in sociocultural analysis of those organizations. The strength of this ethnographic imperative in research design is reflected by the degree of congruency between the descriptive inferences drawn from ethnographic data and the theoretical context within which such inferences are situated.","ethnographic imperative central goal social science developing descriptive causal inferences observable data king keohane verba following perspective propose ethnography methodological imperative seeks develop descriptive inferences influence organizations culture social ecology ethnographic imperative design derived interlocked epistemological commitments design view culture organization constituted system shared knowledge socially transmitted time organizational members second consequence cognitive setting actor models organizational social relationships imperatives cultural nature commitments ethnography methodological imperative enjoined derived cocreational explicitly set sociocultural organizations strength ethnographic imperative design reflected degree congruency descriptive inferences drawn ethnographic data context inferences situated"

Urbanisation will be one of the twenty-first century's biggest drivers of global economic growth (Dobbs et al., 2011) and public relations efforts will need to adapt to reflect the shifting urban environment. We will propose that cities provide opportunities for exploring the meanings, confines and possibilities of public relations as a socio-cultural practice. We will consider how ethnographically-inspired research can help us to further understand how public relations is understood and practised, both formally and informally, in large metropolitan cities and how public relations is influenced by, and can contribute to, urban cultural life. We will propose an ethnographic framework for research to explore the phenomenology of everyday lived experiences of public relations (PR) in relation to the complexity of the global processes which shape today's cities and the PR practices which take place within them.

In spite of the significance of these abilities to corporate reputation management, there has been little effort to document and describe internal organizational influences on such capacities. This ethnographic study conducted in Red Cross Queensland explores how cultural knowledge structures derived from shared values and assumptions among organizational members influence their conceptualisations of organizational reputation. Specifically, this study explores how a central attribute of organizational culture – the property of cultural selection – influences perceptions of organizational reputation held by organizational members. We argue that these perceptions are the result of collective processes that synthesise (with varying degrees of consensus) member conceptualisations, interpretations, and representations of environmental realities in which their organization operates. Findings and implications for organizational action suggest that while external indicators of organizational reputation are acknowledged by members as significant, the internal influence of organizational culture is a far stronger influence on organizational action.","employee perceptions reputation ethnographic ability organizational members identify analyse stakeholder opinion critical management corporate reputation spite significance abilities corporate reputation management little effort document describe internal organizational influences capacities ethnographic conducted red cross queensland cultural knowledge structures derived shared values assumptions organizational members influence conceptualisations organizational reputation central attribute organizational culture property cultural selection influences perceptions organizational reputation held organizational members argue perceptions result collective processes synthesise varying degrees consensus member conceptualisations interpretations representations environmental realities organization operates organizational action external indicators organizational reputation acknowledged members internal influence organizational culture far stronger influence organizational action"

I take a social constructionist approach where the practice of autoethnography presumes that reality is socially constructed and where I, as the autoethnographer, can contribute to the social construction of what is known as public relations practice. I applied an analytical autoethnographic approach and used my own experiences, reflections and memories to construct myself in my writing as an academic and practitioner working within the context of a pro bono public relations consultancy project. The aim of this research was to ascertain whether the Framework for Intentional Positioning in Public Relations could assist practitioners to develop positioning strategies for future programs and campaigns. I applied the positioning framework to the design of a positioning strategy for a small university-affiliated environmental organization. My work indicated that the framework could aid in designing a positioning strategy, however, applying the framework to organizational circumstances could be challenging. The framework was found to have two distinct sections to it when applied to practice and this was not evident in previous analytical work.

These public relations academics and professionals, who were mainly French, represented a body of knowledge which was characterised by an ethical and anthropological approach to public relations. It is this approach that led to Matrat's drafting of the Code of Athens and the creation of a theory of public relations based on human beings. The European doctrine also advocated the application of ethnographic methods to create corporate culture, such as the projet d’entreprise (corporate project).

The CPPC has become a venue for top-down publicity for the powers that be. Because the organizational structure of the CPPC is more centralized than that of other governmental institutions, the form and content of its PR communications are mostly predictable.

Existing studies explain that mega-event images are transferrable to a host country and/or government. Yet, such an assumption has not been widely tested, or studied with country cases. Furthermore, while international mega events are assumed to target chiefly the international community for country branding purposes, there is reason to assert that they may just as much aim at domestic audiences for regime's political legitimization. By focusing on China's recently hosted three mega events – the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, and 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, this study addresses these issues. The analyses reveal that people are likely to associate event images, especially positive ones, with those of China and Chinese government. A set of presumably influential factors, which may either strengthen or weaken that association, are examined, showing that “people's involvement and participation in these events” are the most significant. The findings also verify that internationally oriented mega events can aim at the host country's internal audience. Indeed, solidifying its domestic legitimacy always seems to be an integral part of the Chinese government's strategy in pursuit of a favorable international image.

Hosting global events like the World Expo is a new form of public relations for cities, but few studies have been conducted to explore the extent to which they can change the content of media reports and media attitudes toward city image. We conducted a content analysis of all Shanghai-related news reports from November 2009 to April 2011 on 30 English newspapers in 10 countries. We found a few interesting discoveries. First, the Shanghai Expo 2010 did affect newspapers’ agenda-building, with the Expo being the topic of most reports and the most important news before and during the Expo. Second, the Expo brought changes to the news frames of newspapers, but the changes were still constrained by media practices. Third, the Expo improved newspapers’ attitudes toward Shanghai's city image, particularly toward the city's potential. Finally and most importantly, global events such as the Expo do have a significant impact on the content and attitudes of newspaper reports, but a single event cannot produce long-lasting effects. Therefore improving city image requires “better actions than just better words.”","world expo change citys image foreign media reports hosting global events like world expo new form cities conducted extent change content media reports media attitudes city image conducted content shanghai news reports november april english newspapers countries interesting discoveries shanghai expo affect newspapers agendabuilding expo topic reports important news expo second expo brought changes news frames newspapers changes constrained media practices third expo improved newspapers attitudes shanghais city image particularly citys potential finally importantly global events expo impact content attitudes newspaper reports single event produce longlasting effects therefore improving city image requires better actions just better words"

Guided by the theoretical perspectives of agenda setting and cultivation analysis, the project intends to test whether the highly publicized Olympic Games have a globally accepted effect of bolstering national image, as politicians and governments claim they do. Based on data from panel surveys and the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Medal Index, this study found that the overall performance of a country in the Olympic Games was positively correlated with both its current and comparative scores of national image in the minds of Chinese audiences. However, an increase in the number of medals collected during the two Olympics by developing countries did not benefit national image. Agenda setting theorizes that only a few top agendas can successfully draw attention from the public. National image is a very stable perception built by macro and long-term factors. For most countries, their overall performance in the Olympic Games varies within a limited range. As long as a developed country can stay within its tier, its national image is not likely to diminish. Meanwhile, as long as a developing country is unable to enter the “elite club” of Olympic champions, winning a few medals will not lead to a positive change in its national image.","medals media myth national images chinese audiences thought foreign countries beijing olympics performance country olympics affect national image eyes chinese audience guided perspectives agenda setting cultivation project intends test highly publicized olympic games globally accepted effect bolstering national image politicians governments claim data panel surveys olympic medal index overall performance country olympic games positively correlated current comparative scores national image minds chinese audiences increase number medals collected olympics developing countries benefit national image agenda setting theorizes top agendas successfully draw attention public national image stable perception built macro longterm factors countries overall performance olympic games varies limited range long developed country stay tier national image likely diminish meanwhile long developing country unable enter elite club olympic champions winning medals lead positive change national image"

As an important first step in exploring the possibility of such an application of shared media public diplomacy among nations, this paper describes a complete survey of commercial and public service advertisements collected from the public spaces of subway systems in American and Chinese cities in 2010 – New York, Washington, DC, Shanghai and Beijing – to reveal the range of themes of commercial and public service ads in these spaces. The study reveals first that analogous commercial and public service ads are ubiquitous in the public spaces of both Chinese and American cities. Second, many of the themes that might appear in international or transnational public service ads are already being portrayed in ads created by local or national governments or NGOs, although these themes are portrayed in ads created by different sets of actors in China and in the US: government actors and a few international NGOs in Chinese cities, and governments, corporations and non-profit organizations in the case of American cities. Finally, the survey reveals that in all four cities there are many commercial advertisements that appeal to the identity of a transnational consumer, but that there are almost no public service ads that appeal to the identity of a transnational citizen: merely local or national ones who can solve such public problems as global warming, education, and health issues.","potential international transnational public service advertising public spaces american chinese global cities conclusions survey advertisements subways beijing new york shanghai washington dc construct transnational international public service advertising counterbalance proliferation transnational commercial advertising important step possibility application shared media public diplomacy nations describes complete survey commercial public service advertisements collected public spaces subway systems american chinese cities new york washington dc shanghai beijing reveal range themes commercial public service ads spaces reveals analogous commercial public service ads ubiquitous public spaces chinese american cities second themes might appear international transnational public service ads already portrayed ads created local national governments ngos themes portrayed ads created sets actors china us government actors international ngos chinese cities governments corporations nonprofit organizations case american cities finally survey reveals cities commercial advertisements appeal identity transnational consumer almost public service ads appeal identity transnational citizen merely local national ones solve public problems global warming education health issues"

Content analysis and discourse analysis of media coverage were used. The most significant finding is that Sanlu (a Mainland China-based organization) and KingCar (a Taiwan-based organization) demonstrated inverse pattern of the CCS adoption. Specifically, according to Coombs’ (1998) defense-accommodation continuum, Sanlu's CCSs moved from defensive to accommodative pole as time went by whereas, in contrast, KingCar started with accommodative strategies and moved towards the defensive pole gradually. Besides, the results showed that both organizations adopted denial, corrective action and apology strategies. However, on the Sanlu part, the most frequently used strategy was denial, while KingCar used justification most often. Moreover, this paper suggests that besides cultural dynamics, political and media systems also play a part in corporate selection of CCSs, and they are among the most important factors that should be taken into account to explain the differences in societies even with an identical traditional culture.","comparative crisis communication strategies mainland china taiwan melaminetainted milk powder crisis chinese context purpose twofold identify compare crisis communication strategies ccss organizations used respond congenetic melaminetainted milk crisis chinese societies e mainland china taiwan underlying political media system reasons led differences content discourse media coverage used finding sanlu mainland china organization kingcar taiwan organization demonstrated inverse pattern ccs adoption according coombs defenseaccommodation continuum sanlus ccss moved defensive accommodative pole time went whereas contrast kingcar started accommodative strategies moved towards defensive pole gradually besides organizations adopted denial corrective action apology strategies sanlu frequently used strategy denial kingcar used justification moreover besides cultural dynamics political media systems play corporate selection ccss important factors taken account explain differences societies identical traditional culture"

A case study of the Danish government's response to the so-called Cartoon Crisis illustrates how the threat from international terrorism to national security initially served as a catalyst for new public diplomacy initiatives. But as the initiatives were implemented within a framework of nation branding the focus on risk reduction became subjected to a marketing logic and a new focus on economic objectives took over. The paper points to a possible future status of public diplomacy under the influence of nation branding: Public diplomacy may maintain a function pertinent to national security but as this function is incapable of managing real risks it will only serve as auto-communication that legitimizes security policy towards a domestic audience. In the public diplomacy efforts towards transnational publics the link to national security will completely disappear whereby the public relations of states is transformed to the marketing of states.","new pr states nation branding practices affect security function public diplomacy investigates role practice public diplomacy undergoing transformation consequence influence nation branding case danish governments response called cartoon crisis illustrates threat international terrorism national security initially served catalyst new public diplomacy initiatives initiatives implemented framework nation branding focus risk reduction became subjected marketing logic new focus economic objectives took points possible future status public diplomacy influence nation branding public diplomacy maintain function pertinent national security function incapable managing real risks serve autocommunication legitimizes security policy towards domestic audience public diplomacy efforts towards transnational publics link national security completely disappear whereby states transformed marketing states"

At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, Hutton (2010) refocused them as a matter of survival in the face of marketing attempts “to include or subsume much or all of public relations” (p. 509).

"403",2012,"academic_review","academic","Examining the expertise, experience, and expedience of crisis consultants in Singapore By most accounts, crisis preparedness in organizations globally has been appalling (Burnett, 1998, Pinsdorf, 1991). The situation is no different in Singapore (Wu & Dai, 2001). With crisis expertise often lacking from within organizations, many resort to engaging public relations (PR) agencies to help. This study, which is inspired by Frandsen and Johansen's (2008) study in Denmark, aims to evaluate the contributions of consultants from PR agencies. Adapting indicators to assess professionalism proposed by Lages and Simkin (2003) and Sallot, Cameron and Lariscy (1997) and integrating them with variables from the contingency theory (Pang, Jin, & Cameron, 2010), this study seeks to examine: (1) the level of expertise of consultants in offering crisis management consultancy; (2) the level of experience of consultants offering crisis management consultancy; and (3) the value and expedience of the consultancy services offered. Findings showed that agencies in Singapore hired consultants based on skills such as writing, speaking and ability to manage the media. For some, lack of direct experience was compensated by in-house training. International agencies appeared to have an advantage over the local agencies by virtue of their access to expertise and knowledge from their international network. However, as the majority of agencies had only managed few crises, it was difficult to assess the value these consultants added. Studies examining consultants in PR agencies are rare. It is hoped this study would trigger research around the world.","expertise experience expedience crisis consultants singapore accounts crisis preparedness organizations globally appalling burnett pinsdorf situation singapore wu dai crisis expertise lacking organizations resort engaging pr agencies help inspired frandsen johansens denmark aims evaluate contributions consultants pr agencies adapting indicators assess professionalism proposed lages simkin sallot cameron lariscy integrating variables contingency pang jin cameron seeks level expertise consultants offering crisis management consultancy level experience consultants offering crisis management consultancy value expedience consultancy services offered agencies singapore hired consultants skills writing speaking ability manage media lack direct experience compensated house training international agencies appeared advantage local agencies virtue access expertise knowledge international network majority agencies managed crises difficult assess value consultants added consultants pr agencies rare hoped trigger around world"

This paper argues that the central ethical tension facing public relations as a field lies in its divided ethical identity, in particular between the idealized codes of conduct influenced by the US-based excellence project, which conjure images of wise counsel balancing duties to client and society, and practitioner-led expectations that they are advocates and should privilege clients over society. The paper touches on the wider context of professional ethics in the early 21st century from western and non-western perspectives, in order to frame current debates in public relations’ ethics. Taking a Jungian approach, it suggests that the saint/sinner models represent opposing aspects of an ethical identity or archetype which can only be resolved through self-acceptance and a willingness to embrace contradiction.","saints sinners competing identities ethics ethics confused superficial relying heavily traditional occasional reference recent developments professional ethics particularly feminist global ethical perspectives argues central ethical tension facing field lies divided ethical identity particular idealized codes conduct influenced us excellence project conjure images wise counsel balancing duties client society practitionerled expectations advocates privilege clients society touches wider context professional ethics early century western nonwestern perspectives order frame current debates ethics taking jungian saintsinner models represent opposing aspects ethical identity archetype resolved selfacceptance willingness embrace contradiction"
"405",2012,"academic_review","academic","Public relations and community: A persistent covenant In the 21st Century global public relations professional community, the need for a postmodern reformation is compellingly evident. Most theorizing begins with basic assumptions about the three main social actors for which public relations has been practiced: (1) corporations, (2) nongovernmental and civil society organizations (NGOs and CSOs), and (3) governments. Questions about society itself are rarely examined, but when they do come up, scholars and practitioners tend to assume generally accepted values and mores. Neglected has been a robust criticism of the concepts upon which such paradigms have been built. The authors argue that earlier paradigms are mostly inadequate in addressing the needs of a 21st Century in which communication technology is creating rapid globalization while it is dangerously exacerbating the tensions of multiculturalism. Through a critical discussion of prior assumptions and paradigms in public relations scholarship, the authors underline the need for public relations to revitalize and bring its body of knowledge into the 21st Century. The authors posit and discuss how the community-building theory originally espoused by Kruckeberg and Starck (1988) and modified in subsequent scholarship can provide a viable departure point toward developing new approaches to research about and practice of public relations that can take into account the dynamic environment wrought by changes in communication technology.","community persistent covenant century global professional community need postmodern reformation compellingly evident theorizing begins basic assumptions main social actors practiced corporations nongovernmental civil society organizations ngos csos governments questions society rarely come scholars practitioners tend assume generally accepted values mores neglected robust criticism concepts upon paradigms built argue earlier paradigms mostly inadequate addressing needs century communication technology creating rapid globalization dangerously exacerbating tensions multiculturalism critical discussion prior assumptions paradigms scholarship underline need revitalize bring body knowledge century posit discuss communitybuilding originally espoused kruckeberg starck modified subsequent scholarship viable departure point developing new practice take account dynamic environment wrought changes communication technology"

We argue that Excellence Theory‘s seemingly reluctant evolution has provided unsatisfactory treatments of concepts like power and activism, even though it has attempted to address some limitations of the symmetrical model's efficacy in responding to activist challenges. Excellence Theory‘s acknowledgment of once-vilified concepts like persuasion and power sets the stage for critical public relations theory and research to emerge as significantly more capable of addressing activist advocacy and concomitant issues. The paper argues that critical theory, buoyed by acceptance of its key concepts, its increasing access to presentation venues and journals sympathetic to once-marginalized, alternative perspectives, is poised to infiltrate the public relations orthodoxy.

It also considers the context of the recent global economic crisis, which brought about the lowest levels of trust in corporations, and a serious erosion of reputational capital of the corporations previously regarded as highly reputable. It maps out the semantic content of corporate reputation in an attempt to capture the ideas that individuals associate with this concept and to contrast it with the established standard reputational measures of reputation. The empirical part is based on semantic network analysis, a special form of social network analysis, where connections are formed by the use of overlapping concepts. The results show that there are a few strong determinants of reputation. They mainly coincide with the established reputational measures; however, some strong determinates seem to be context-specific and reflect the current global economic and financial crisis.

Specifically, we attempted to stay away from the functional approach of examining PR outcomes, and focus on how institutional actors “navigate” the existing cultural contexts for institutionalising PR. We used triangulate methods based on 40 semi-structured interviews, participant observation and document collections. We found that PR actors do not passively respond to institutional pressures, but rather creatively and reflexively interpret and incorporate existing cultural aspects, especially guanxi and harmony, to construct and transform their PR practices. These practices offer insights into why and how guanxi, as well as other cultural factors, are integrated and legitimised in PR practice in China.","institutional perspective practices chinese cultural contexts respond recent call sociological turn promotion institutional thought propose novel framework institutional work studying pr practice chinese cultural contexts attempted stay away functional pr outcomes focus institutional actors navigate existing cultural contexts institutionalising pr used triangulate methods semistructured interviews participant observation document collections pr actors passively respond institutional pressures creatively reflexively interpret incorporate existing cultural aspects especially guanxi harmony construct transform pr practices practices insights guanxi cultural factors integrated legitimised pr practice china"

The study examined a segment of Peruvian civil society dedicated to media development, as media is a key partner in building civil society (Taylor, 2009).

According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 99.9% of the corporations in Italy are SMEs employing fewer than 250 people. This study sought to explore the CSR among SMEs including whether they practice CSR as a strategic function, who the main stakeholders were for their CSR activities, the drivers of CSR, and the motivations to engage in CSR. Data were collected from three sources: a survey of executives of a sample of 105 SMEs; qualitative in-depth interviews of the owner–managers of five SMEs and élite interviews with opinion leaders. The sample organizations practiced CSR mainly through informal, internally oriented and relational methods with very little, if any, managerial and strategic approach. A large number of sample organizations viewed employees as the most important stakeholders for CSR communication whereas customers, suppliers, and business partners trailed far behind. Interestingly, the media, government, NGOs, and unions were relegated to the bottom of the list. Networks of personal relationships (including that of owner–managers and top executives) were frequently used to conduct CSR activities.",""

However, classical crisis communication theories neglect the role of the medium and focus mainly on the interplay between crisis type and crisis communication strategy. Building on the recently developed “networked crisis communication model” we contrast effects of medium (Facebook vs. Twitter vs. online newspaper) and crisis type (intentional vs. victim) in an online experiment. Using the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster as crisis scenario, we show that medium effects are stronger than the effects of crisis type. Crisis communication via social media resulted in a higher reputation and less secondary crisis reactions such as boycotting the company than crisis communication in the newspaper. However, secondary crisis communication, e.g. talking about the crisis communication, was higher in the newspaper condition than in the social media conditions because people consider traditional media as more credible. We also found higher levels of anger in the intentional crisis condition than in the victim crisis condition. Anger in turn was related to reputation, secondary crisis communication and secondary crisis reaction. The results stress the need for more complex models of crisis communication.","crisis communication online medium crisis emotions affected public reactions fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster social media play todays societies fundamental role negotiation dynamics crises classical crisis communication neglect role medium focus mainly interplay crisis crisis communication strategy building recently developed networked crisis communication contrast effects medium facebook vs twitter vs online newspaper crisis intentional vs victim online experiment using fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster crisis scenario medium effects stronger effects crisis crisis communication via social media resulted higher reputation secondary crisis reactions boycotting company crisis communication newspaper secondary crisis communication eg talking crisis communication higher newspaper condition social media conditions people consider traditional media credible higher levels anger intentional crisis condition victim crisis condition anger turn reputation secondary crisis communication secondary crisis reaction stress need complex models crisis communication"

"431",2013,"academic_review","academic","Personal influence and pre-industrial United States: An early relationship model that needs resurgence in U.S. public relations The personal influence model of public relations, using one's influence to seek favor with government and other power bases, is seen as most applicable in Asia but also is found elsewhere in the world. Only a few writings have explicitly broached the possibility that the personal influence model is practiced in the United States. Muzi Falconi (2010) argued that U.S. public relations emphasizes persuasion, espoused by Bernays and brought to fruition through one-way messaging. While it is easy to see persuasion as dominating U.S. practice, such observation ignores the prevalence of personal influence through at least 150 years of U.S. society. As early settlers built agrarian communities, interpersonal communication fostered community pride and solidarity. During World War II, Katz and Lazarsfeld identified personal influence as a major element in U.S. communication, overriding the mass media in importance. Even today much public relations activity in the U.S. consists of organizations seeking favor from the power elites. However, with the focus on message control, scholars have overlooked the efforts and effects of personal influence. The purpose of this paper is to identify early evidences of the personal influence model in the U.S. Today, the increasing power of social media and virtual stakeholders renders the persuasion model as somewhat specious. It is time to reexamine the concept of personal influence and the greater promise it holds for returning to what public relations was and should be in the first place—a function for maintaining relationships.","personal influence preindustrial united states early relationship needs resurgence us personal influence using s influence seek favor government power bases seen applicable asia elsewhere world writings explicitly broached possibility personal influence practiced united states muzi falconi argued us emphasizes persuasion espoused bernays brought fruition way messaging easy see persuasion dominating us practice observation ignores prevalence personal influence least years us society early settlers built agrarian communities interpersonal communication fostered community pride solidarity world war ii katz lazarsfeld identified personal influence major element us communication overriding mass media importance today much activity us consists organizations seeking favor power elites focus message control scholars overlooked efforts effects personal influence purpose identify early evidences personal influence us today increasing power social media virtual stakeholders renders persuasion somewhat specious time reexamine concept personal influence greater promise holds returning place function maintaining relationships"

Once disseminated, even baseless accusations can persist and cause considerable damage for a company. This study examines the proactive crisis communication strategy of inoculating individuals against invalid accusations before they go viral. An experiment was conducted in a real world consumer context among members of an online consumer panel using an electronics discounter as the research stimulus. Expanding previous inoculation research on the role of value-relevant involvement for inoculation and the effectiveness of inoculation in the case of different preexisting attitudes, we find that consumers’ identification with a company moderates inoculation effectiveness. Consumers strongly opposing or disidentifying with the company under attack reported fewer negative beliefs and attitude change as well as fewer intentions to spread the accusation after being exposed to an inoculation message refuting the claim against the company. Consumers strongly identifying with the company, on the other hand, did not profit from such an inoculation. Their level of identification alone was sufficient to prevent attitude slippage. Implications for public relations research and practice are discussed.","countering accusations inoculation moderating role consumercompany identification accusations wrongdoing baseless justified severely tarnish companys reputation disseminated baseless accusations persist cause considerable damage company proactive crisis communication strategy inoculating individuals invalid accusations go viral experiment conducted real world consumer context members online consumer panel using electronics discounter stimulus expanding previous inoculation role valuerelevant involvement inoculation effectiveness inoculation case preexisting attitudes find consumers identification company moderates inoculation effectiveness consumers strongly opposing disidentifying company attack reported fewer negative beliefs attitude change fewer intentions spread accusation exposed inoculation message refuting claim company consumers strongly identifying company hand profit inoculation level identification alone sufficient prevent attitude slippage practice"

Though much of feedback is related to stakeholder experiences, we propose that it is more beneficial to study expectations than experiences, as expectations affect future satisfaction. This study reports a process of collecting and analyzing stakeholder expectations in one health-care oriented public sector organization in Finland, and reports how these expectations and their implications were assessed by the organization's top management. The study suggests that to ensure stakeholder satisfaction and organizational success, top management should be guided to work through the feedback. We propose a “fix or fit” approach where expectations are first grouped and then analyzed as either something that requires changing of organizational functions, or as something that requires guiding of stakeholders’ expectations to fit existing functions.","expectation management public sector organizations transparency collecting stakeholder feedback becoming norm public sector though much feedback stakeholder experiences propose beneficial expectations experiences expectations affect future satisfaction reports process collecting analyzing stakeholder expectations healthcare oriented public sector organization finland reports expectations assessed organizations top management ensure stakeholder satisfaction organizational success top management guided work feedback propose fix fit expectations grouped analyzed either something requires changing organizational functions something requires guiding stakeholders expectations fit existing functions"

Discussions of democracy, rhetoric, and public relations can conclude that these aspects of society and professional practice are contradictory paradoxes or partners for achieving harmony of collective interests. To that end, this paper briefly explores the rhetorical heritage as inseparable from democracy. It next examines, through the challenges of the public arena, ways that deliberative democracy can bring the three into partnership for the greater good. On this foundation, it features four premises of public relations and democracy based on power, infrastructure, private and public sphere, collective voices, language that co-manages meaning as social construction, and stewardship. As stewards of democracy, organizations can play a pivotal role in fostering environments, the infrastructures and collaborative processes, that allow and even facilitate collective decision making as well as blend the private sphere (individualism) and the public sphere (collectivism) so that self-interest can be satisfied and enjoyed by organizations and myriad publics as collective interests. By blending individual voices into collective voices and understanding the limits and pitfalls of language as culture, public relations can actually serve private interests by the co-management of meaning to make society better.","universe democracy rhetoric whole cloth separate galaxies discussions democracy rhetoric conclude aspects society professional practice contradictory paradoxes partners achieving harmony collective interests end briefly rhetorical heritage inseparable democracy next challenges public arena ways deliberative democracy bring partnership greater good foundation features premises democracy power infrastructure private public sphere collective voices language comanages meaning social construction stewardship stewards democracy organizations play pivotal role fostering environments infrastructures collaborative processes allow facilitate collective decision making blend private sphere individualism public sphere collectivism selfinterest satisfied enjoyed organizations myriad publics collective interests blending individual voices collective voices limits pitfalls language culture actually serve private interests comanagement meaning make society better"
"456",2013,"academic_review","academic","The civility of social capital: Public relations in the public sphere, civil society, and democracy Scholars have analyzed public relations’ role in democracy via proxy concepts like the public sphere and civil society. However, some have critiqued the public sphere on grounds of equal access and portrayed civil society as a guise for first-world imperialism. These critiques have implications for the role of public relations in the public sphere and civil society. This article suggests the normative role of public relations in democracy is best perceived as creating the social capital that facilitates access to spheres of public discussion and in maintaining relationships among those organizations that check state power. To that end, the paper argues that social capital does much to advance public relations theory and prescribe the role of public relations in democracy. Several implications for public relations from a social capital perspective are offered, including the creation of generalized societal trust, the building of cross-cutting or “weak” ties, the engagement of media on behalf of subaltern counterpublics, and the (re)creation of community or a fully functioning society.","civility social capital public sphere civil society democracy scholars analyzed role democracy via proxy concepts like public sphere civil society critiqued public sphere grounds equal access portrayed civil society guise world imperialism critiques role public sphere civil society normative role democracy best perceived creating social capital facilitates access spheres public discussion maintaining relationships organizations check state power end argues social capital much advance prescribe role democracy several social capital perspective offered creation generalized societal trust building crosscutting weak ties engagement media behalf subaltern counterpublics recreation community fully functioning society"

Consociationalism has been advocated as a form of democracy which can reconcile post-conflict societies fragmented along ethnic, religious or linguistic lines. Political public relations within mandatory coalitions have received little attention from scholars to date. Drawing on data from elite interviews with Government Information Officers (GIOs), Ministerial Special Advisers (SpAds) and journalists in Northern Ireland, this paper analyses their perspectives on political public relations in Northern Ireland's evolving democratic institutions. Our findings suggest Northern Ireland's public sphere is characterized not just by the usual contest between government communicators and journalists over political stories, but also by competition across government departments and within departments between GIOs and SpAds. Our research investigates the role of public relations in Northern Ireland's developing democratic institutions and more generally identifies important issues surrounding government communication in post-conflict power-sharing democracies.","powersharing political governmentpress relationships northern irelands developing democratic institutions northern irelands democratic governance consociational e powersharing mandatory therefore substantially majoritarian electoral system characterizes western democratic societies consociationalism advocated form democracy reconcile postconflict societies fragmented along ethnic religious linguistic lines political mandatory coalitions received little attention scholars date drawing data elite interviews government information officers gios ministerial special advisers spads journalists northern ireland analyses perspectives political northern irelands evolving democratic institutions northern irelands public sphere characterized just usual contest government communicators journalists political stories competition government departments departments gios spads investigates role northern irelands developing democratic institutions generally identifies important issues surrounding government communication postconflict powersharing democracies"

To gain empirical insight into the formation of negativity, dramatization, game- and conflict-centeredness in campaign communication in the 2008 Austrian elections, this study introduces a biaxial matrix localizing levels of confrontation (negativity and conflict) and entertainment (game and drama). The analysis rests on the comparative investigation of generic frames in political parties’ PR and the media, and the examination of underlying frame building processes. The role of journalism and political public relations in shaping campaign communication is investigated by utilizing concerted content analyses of newspaper and TV news coverage and party press releases. The study finds that Austrian party and media communication can be predominantly categorized as antagonistic substance, characterized by high levels of confrontation (negativity and conflict) and lower levels of entertainment (game and drama). The empirical investigation outlines that conflict and negativity are prevalent features of the electoral communication of Austrian parties and the media likewise, whereby party press releases are even more marked by confrontation and entertainment framing than the subsequent media coverage. In addition, the media are not the principal and exclusive sponsors of confrontation and entertainment in electoral communication; rather, they even moderately decrease conflict and drama as compared to the impulses set by political PR.","generic frame building austrian elections media critics repeatedly refer adversarial trivializing nature contemporary political journalism whereas role political formation aspects public political discourse widely neglected gain empirical insight formation negativity dramatization game conflictcenteredness campaign communication austrian elections introduces biaxial matrix localizing levels confrontation negativity conflict entertainment game drama rests comparative investigation generic frames political parties pr media examination underlying frame building processes role journalism political shaping campaign communication investigated utilizing concerted content analyses newspaper tv news coverage party press releases finds austrian party media communication predominantly categorized antagonistic substance characterized high levels confrontation negativity conflict lower levels entertainment game drama empirical investigation outlines conflict negativity prevalent features electoral communication austrian parties media likewise whereby party press releases marked confrontation entertainment framing subsequent media coverage addition media principal exclusive sponsors confrontation entertainment electoral communication moderately decrease conflict drama compared impulses set political pr"

These government communication channels are often regarded to promote democratic values and public trust in government by helping the government provide the public with information and respond to citizen inquires. Further, such channels help the public provide the government with feedback. This study questions whether individuals’ experience with government websites and social media do, in fact, influence their perception of the government-public relationship (represented by public trust in government). The results, which are based on a nationwide survey of more than 2000 American citizens, showed support for a positive relationship between this online experience and public trust in government. In particular, experiences with informational online services and social media were associated with greater trust in government at the local and state levels, while those with transactional online services conveyed greater trust in the federal government.

The analysis reveals that WikiLeaks emerged as the center of a global mass self-communication network consisting of a diverse group of members, such as social media sites and mass media outlets.

A content analysis on financial news coverage (2281 newspaper articles from 2004 to 2010) in Hong Kong was conducted to examine how print media reported financial and nonfinancial information on 38 IPO firms in the sectors of financial, properties and construction, and consumer goods. Results from partial least squares analysis showed that, although substantive media reputation and recency of news coverage together only explained a small proportion of changes in IPO share price, substantive media reputation has a significant positive effect on changes in IPO share price. Apart from the significant positive effect from the presentation tone of environmental attributes, the tone of social attributes had a significant negative effect on substantive media reputation. With the increasing concern on measuring media reputation attributes in financial news coverage across different contexts, this study contributes to the applicability of environmental and product-resource attributes in the specific context of IPOs.","media reputation initial public offerings financial news coverage hong kong investigated media reputation initial public offerings ipos proposing eight attributes substantive media reputation environmental productresource perspectives content financial news coverage newspaper hong kong conducted print media reported financial nonfinancial information ipo firms sectors financial properties construction consumer goods partial least squares substantive media reputation recency news coverage together explained small proportion changes ipo share price substantive media reputation positive effect changes ipo share price apart positive effect presentation tone environmental attributes tone social attributes negative effect substantive media reputation increasing concern measuring media reputation attributes financial news coverage contexts contributes applicability environmental productresource attributes context ipos"

Since the workforce is “graying,” the question now becomes how to best utilize this growing segment of the population within an organizational context. This case study applied framing analysis to the BMW Today for Tomorrow program in order to understand how BMW built support for its efforts to create a more age diverse workforce. This initiative was intended to redesign the production lines at BMW in order to become more age-appropriate for BMW's increasingly older employees. The Today for Tomorrow program included the implementation of over 70 small changes that improved the efficiency of an experimental production line (e.g., magnifying glasses, stretching station, wooden floors, and ergonomic standing chairs). Several texts were analyzed including media stories, the organizational website, and the BMW Sustainability Report. Based on this case study, BMW's Today for Tomorrow program contained two overarching frames that aided in the attempt to highlight its age appropriate workplace initiatives. These frames are age as a valuable resource and BMW as a responsible organization. In addition, BMW incorporated both episodic (specific examples) and thematic (general context) framing techniques in order to localize and globalize the issue of an aging workforce simultaneously.","frames present bmw embracing aging workforce population begins age organizations starting plan influx older employees since workforce graying question now becomes best utilize growing segment population organizational context case applied framing bmw today tomorrow program order bmw built support efforts create age diverse workforce initiative intended redesign production lines bmw order become ageappropriate bmws increasingly older employees today tomorrow program included implementation small changes improved efficiency experimental production line eg magnifying glasses stretching station wooden floors ergonomic standing chairs several texts analyzed media stories organizational website bmw sustainability report case bmws today tomorrow program contained overarching frames aided attempt highlight age appropriate workplace initiatives frames age valuable resource bmw responsible organization addition bmw incorporated episodic examples thematic general context framing techniques order localize globalize issue aging workforce simultaneously"

This study looks at three ways organizations have framed their corporate environmental responsibility over the past 30 years. Specifically, the study finds that organizations focus on the way their environmental behaviors contribute to solutions (gain frame) rather than prevent environmental problems (loss frame). They focus on solving problems for the current generation rather than future generations, and they promote their actions (doing more) rather than promote their conservation (taking less from the earth). However, some differences in framing and use of environmental topic emerge over time.","framing environmental responsibility years csr messages national geographic magazine decades corporations promoting responsible behaviors environment looks ways organizations framed corporate environmental responsibility past years finds organizations focus way environmental behaviors contribute solutions gain frame prevent environmental problems loss frame focus solving problems current generation future generations promote actions promote conservation taking earth differences framing use environmental topic emerge time"

Changes in work routines and tactics were examined by means of quantitative content analysis, the internet visibility of 453 PR agencies in Israel and 23 interviews with PR personnel. The findings indicate the following: (1) the internet visibility of the PR agencies examined was low, and less than a quarter were active in the social platforms that were defined.

Clues from sixteen Danish companies A given characteristic of successful corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs is that they reflect stakeholder expectations and preferences for corporate behavior. This study examines the process by which this alignment is sought by CSR managers in the CSR strategy-making process. Through reliance on stakeholder management theories, and with a particular focus on how and why managers communicate with stakeholders, the extent to which the company-stakeholder alignment process in CSR strategy-making reflects modern, enlightened approaches to stakeholder relations is assessed. This assessment is based on an analysis of structured, in-depth interviews with CSR managers from sixteen industry-leading, Danish companies. The managers’ descriptions of their interactions with stakeholders reveal that their practices fall short of the normative, theoretical ideals since their focus is primarily on just listening to others in the strategy-making process rather than directly involving others in decision-making. Also, because non-stakeholders, such as paid-for consultants, are found to be note-worthy influencers in the CSR strategy-making process, it is concluded that the process is not only a stakeholder management exercise, but an expert, institutionalized, strategic issues management exercise as well.","stakeholder involvement csr strategymaking clues sixteen danish companies given characteristic successful corporate social responsibility csr programs reflect stakeholder expectations preferences corporate behavior process alignment sought csr managers csr strategymaking process reliance stakeholder management particular focus managers communicate stakeholders extent companystakeholder alignment process csr strategymaking reflects modern enlightened stakeholder relations assessed assessment structured depth interviews csr managers sixteen industryleading danish companies managers descriptions interactions stakeholders reveal practices fall short normative ideals since focus primarily just listening others strategymaking process directly involving others decisionmaking nonstakeholders paid consultants noteworthy influencers csr strategymaking process concluded process stakeholder management exercise expert institutionalized strategic issues management exercise"
"516",2014,"academic_review","academic","Articulating influence: Toward a research agenda for interpreting the evaluation of soft power, public diplomacy and nation brands While the terms soft power, public diplomacy (PD) and nation brands have cemented their place in academic discourse during the early 21st century, the evaluation of these activities has not been given anywhere near the same level of attention. When describing how campaigns are evaluated, scholars tend to make assumptions based on the goals or outputs of an initiative rather than on the basis of reliable, empirical data on its results. Strong positivist tendencies within current scholarship usually lead to evaluation being considered in terms of methodology and best practice, typically with the assumption that certain preferred outcomes will be demonstrable if an ideal model is followed. Most significantly, such approaches seem to underplay the interests and objectives that inform and constrain choices surrounding modes of communication and evaluation. I argue here that PD activities are rarely the product of rational choices about communication options, and nor is PD evaluation the result of applying the “best” methodology. Rather, questions of PD and evaluation practices are bound together in complex organizational and power structures that generate pragmatic responses both to the “problem of influence” and the reporting of results. Through use of the concept of articulation, this article outlines a framework for interpreting evaluation practices from a contextualized perspective, which grasps how and why soft power practices assume certain forms.","articulating influence agenda interpreting evaluation soft power public diplomacy nation brands terms soft power public diplomacy pd nation brands cemented place academic discourse early century evaluation activities given anywhere near level attention describing campaigns evaluated scholars tend make assumptions goals outputs initiative basis reliable empirical data strong positivist tendencies current scholarship usually lead evaluation considered terms methodology best practice typically assumption certain preferred outcomes demonstrable ideal followed significantly seem underplay interests objectives inform constrain choices surrounding modes communication evaluation argue pd activities rarely product rational choices communication options pd evaluation result applying best methodology questions pd evaluation practices bound together complex organizational power structures generate pragmatic responses problem influence reporting use concept articulation outlines framework interpreting evaluation practices contextualized perspective grasps soft power practices assume certain forms"

Although different items were used, the results of this study were similar to the findings of a study conducted on European PR practitioners by Beurer-Zullig, Fieseler, and Meckel (2009) thus suggesting concurrent validity. Five PR roles were found incorporating personal characteristics, modes of communication, management and technical functions, perceived level of respondent strategic planning process involvement, and attitudes about communication goals and PR measurement (including perceived competency).

These active practitioners reported strong preferences in using more proactive conflict coping strategies, such as rational action and positive thinking. Women and those with a graduate degree tend to report more coping behaviors than others. Three types of stressors are identified as sources of work-life conflict: behavior-driven, work-driven, and life-driven. According to our findings, while behavior-driven work-life stressors are associated with proactive coping strategies such as rational action and positive thinking, work-driven stressors tended to trigger more avoidance. Non-work driven stressors seem to predict more passive coping tendencies, such as denial and avoidance. Organizational factors are found to be important in understanding how practitioners cope with work-life conflict. As organizational demands increased to separate life from work, more instructions seemed necessary for employees to better cope with work-life conflicts. Positive thinking, as a type of cognitive coping, tends to increase when there is more immediate supervisor support and to decrease when an organization's work-life culture is skewed toward promoting work as the sole priority.","tuning rhythm role coping strategic management worklife conflicts profession practitioners cope worklife conflict studied national survey random sample prsa society america members active practitioners reported strong preferences using proactive conflict coping strategies rational action positive thinking women graduate degree tend report coping behaviors others stressors identified sources worklife conflict behaviordriven workdriven lifedriven according behaviordriven worklife stressors associated proactive coping strategies rational action positive thinking workdriven stressors tended trigger avoidance nonwork driven stressors seem predict passive coping tendencies denial avoidance organizational factors important practitioners cope worklife conflict organizational demands increased separate life work instructions seemed necessary employees better cope worklife conflicts positive thinking cognitive coping tends increase immediate supervisor support decrease organizations worklife culture skewed promoting work sole priority"

However, there are also drawbacks. Arguably the most important one is increased complexity. Many communication departments use a multitude of platforms ranging from corporate websites, campaign microsites and blogs to services like Facebook and Twitter to communicate with stakeholders. Social Media Newsrooms (SMNRs) have been introduced as instruments to reduce this complexity. The basic idea is straightforward: SMNRs aggregate social media content provided by the organization and/or thematic content about the organization and its key issues from several platforms in one place. Although SMNRs have been used in public relations practice around the world since the concept was first introduced in 2007, empirical evidence is still missing. This paper closes the research gap by (a) introducing SMNRs from a conceptual perspective based on a literature review, (b) exploring opportunities and challenges for strategic communication, (c) researching empirical manifestations and modes of usage by corporations in three major international markets (United States, United Kingdom, and Germany) based on a comprehensive content analysis of the 600 largest companies and 2045 affiliated brands and subsidiaries, and (d) explaining implications for the practice of public relations.","social media newsrooms conceptual framework corporate practices countries rise social media organizational settings opened new horizons strategic communication drawbacks arguably important increased complexity communication departments use multitude platforms ranging corporate websites campaign microsites blogs services like facebook twitter communicate stakeholders social media newsrooms smnrs introduced instruments reduce complexity basic idea straightforward smnrs aggregate social media content provided organization thematic content organization issues several platforms place smnrs used practice around world since concept introduced empirical evidence missing closes gap introducing smnrs conceptual perspective review b opportunities challenges strategic communication c researching empirical manifestations modes usage corporations major international markets united states united kingdom germany comprehensive content largest companies affiliated brands subsidiaries d explaining practice"

A stakeholder perspective from South Africa Companies are being forced to critically re-evaluate how they communicate their financial information to stakeholders. Integrated Reporting, as mandated by the King III Report seeks to combine the reporting of financial and nonfinancial performance measures in a way that promotes corporate strategy. South Africa is leading the way in corporate governance and financial reporting with the first large-scale adoption of Integrated Reporting by listed companies. While there is a marked increase in financial communication from companies, it is not clear how all stakeholders use and value this information. The primary aim of this paper was to investigate how financial information is consumed within the ambit of the new financial reporting standards. Through a national online survey, this study found that very few stakeholders use the Integrated Reports as their main source of financial and investment information, and that these reports are seen as additional information. Annual and interim financial reports by companies are still the mainstay for corporate financial information. While stakeholders currently seldom use the Internet for financial information, they have indicated that they would increasingly prefer to do so. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and challenges that future Integrated Reporting faces based on these findings.","integrated reporting silver bullet financial communication stakeholder perspective south africa companies forced critically reevaluate communicate financial information stakeholders integrated reporting mandated king iii report seeks combine reporting financial nonfinancial performance measures way promotes corporate strategy south africa leading way corporate governance financial reporting largescale adoption integrated reporting listed companies marked increase financial communication companies clear stakeholders use value information primary aim investigate financial information consumed ambit new financial reporting standards national online survey stakeholders use integrated reports main source financial investment information reports seen additional information annual interim financial reports companies mainstay corporate financial information stakeholders currently seldom use internet financial information indicated increasingly prefer concludes discussion opportunities challenges future integrated reporting faces"

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines are the international reporting standard whereas the Johannesburg Securities Exchange Socially Responsible Investment (JSE SRI) Index guidelines are used in South Africa. Although South Africa is regarded as one of the leaders in sustainability reporting in the world, the JSE SRI Index is still a relatively new standard and its efficiency will only be proved over time. The research on which this paper is based, determined whether reporting patterns exist across specific market sectors of the sustainability reports of companies listed on the JSE in order to establish if the JSE SRI Index guidelines on reporting are efficient. Results indicated that all the selected market sectors reported on the environment, society and governance (ESG) categories as per requirements of the JSE SRI Index. The mining and materials sector reported more in the environment and the society categories than the other sectors, while in the governance category less reporting on indirect impacts by all the sectors was noted. The implication of this is that in general, companies find the JSE SRI Index guidelines on reporting easy to implement. However, less reporting of companies’ indirect impacts on their operating environments could mean that there is still a lack of completeness and transparency from the companies’ reports, which could be as a result of a lack of firmer guidelines by the JSE SRI Index guidelines on reporting of such issues.","sustainability reporting patterns companies listed johannesburg securities exchange demand stakeholders information companies social environmental performance led sustainability reporting becoming essential global reporting initiative gri guidelines international reporting standard whereas johannesburg securities exchange socially responsible investment jse sri index guidelines used south africa south africa regarded leaders sustainability reporting world jse sri index relatively new standard efficiency proved time determined reporting patterns exist market sectors sustainability reports companies listed jse order establish jse sri index guidelines reporting efficient indicated selected market sectors reported environment society governance esg categories per requirements jse sri index mining materials sector reported environment society categories sectors governance category reporting indirect impacts sectors noted implication general companies find jse sri index guidelines reporting easy implement reporting companies indirect impacts operating environments mean lack completeness transparency companies reports result lack firmer guidelines jse sri index guidelines reporting issues"

The King Reports on Governance for South Africa are internationally respected for proposing integrated reporting in a triple bottom-line business context to improve corporate governance. The most recent report, King III, views stakeholder relationship management as a key tenet of corporate governance. This raises the question whether public relations professionals (PRPs) understand the principles of corporate governance well-enough to inform and guide organizations on the management of stakeholder relationships. The views of senior PRPs at selected top performing companies were elicited on their practice of stakeholder relationship management in line with corporate governance principles. It was found that their knowledge on corporate governance was limited, although they recognized its importance. They propose six role functions for managing stakeholder relationships on a strategic or managerial level; these role functions are aligned with the King III principles on stakeholder relationships. The following three were of particular importance: developing a corporate strategy, giving advice to senior management and managing crisis communication. Different terminologies were used to build relations with stakeholders and different approaches were used to profile stakeholders. It is recommended that organizations leverage their public relations functions on strategic and managerial levels in support of their corporate governance efforts. In turn, PRPs are encouraged to ensure a deep knowledge on corporate governance issues when counseling senior management on building stakeholder relationships.","professionals corporate governance issues enough advise companies stakeholder relationship management king reports governance south africa internationally respected proposing integrated reporting triple bottomline business context improve corporate governance recent report king iii views stakeholder relationship management tenet corporate governance raises question professionals prps principles corporate governance enough inform guide organizations management stakeholder relationships views senior prps selected top performing companies elicited practice stakeholder relationship management line corporate governance principles knowledge corporate governance limited recognized importance propose six role functions managing stakeholder relationships strategic managerial level role functions aligned king iii principles stakeholder relationships following particular importance developing corporate strategy giving advice senior management managing crisis communication terminologies used build relations stakeholders used profile stakeholders recommended organizations leverage functions strategic managerial levels support corporate governance efforts turn prps encouraged ensure deep knowledge corporate governance issues counseling senior management building stakeholder relationships"

However, many times the practitioner fails to accomplish this undertaking (Grunig et al., 2002, Tobin, 2004, Van Ruler, 1997). Practitioners, researchers and professional bodies from various countries have researched, and tried to suggest the abilities, skills, knowledge and approach that practitioners should have and take, in order to make a contribution to organisational performance. However, no study has provided a comprehensive prioritised list of all these variables in order to describe the practitioner that contributes to organisational performance. In light of this problem, this study tries to describe the South African public relations practitioner that will be able to contribute to organisational performance. The study firstly prioritises and tests all the variables influencing practitioners listed in literature against the views of South African practitioners in top performing organisations. Secondly the study, through the use of structural equation modelling, builds a model that describes the variables pertaining to a South African practitioner that contribute to organisational performance, from the view of South African practitioners. The study is framed within the relational, reflective, two-way symmetrical and feminist paradigms, supported by the general excellence theory as meta-theory, and the relationship management and corporate communication role theories.

It is conceivable that these different population groups may have differing perceptions of taxation resulting from their cultural backgrounds or even their political and social histories. These perceptions may, in turn, influence their attitudes towards tax compliance. It is, therefore, argued that in order to change taxpaying behaviour, perceptions must be first be identified, and then influenced in a positive way towards tax compliance. This study extends prior research by investigating and comparing taxpayers’ perceptions amongst the four major South African population groups (that is, Black/African, Indian, Coloured and White). The data for this study was collected from a sample of 260 South African taxpayers by means of face-to-face interviews, based on a questionnaire, compiled from an extensive literature review. The scope of the study was limited as it focused only on natural taxpayers within the Tshwane metropolitan area (which includes Pretoria, the capital city of South Africa) in Gauteng, as the purpose was not to generalise conclusions to the entire South African population. It was found that different population groups in South Africa may have different perceptions towards taxation. In order to create a more positive tax culture, government could possibly focus more strongly on educating the various population groups about the importance of paying their taxes. A multifaceted approach is needed in order to understand and influence the large number of factors that play a role in individual behaviour.","perceptions taxation comparative population groups south africa south africa country diverse cultures languages beliefs backgrounds conceivable population groups differing perceptions taxation resulting cultural backgrounds political social histories perceptions turn influence attitudes towards tax compliance therefore argued order change taxpaying behaviour perceptions must identified influenced positive way towards tax compliance extends prior investigating comparing taxpayers perceptions amongst major south african population groups blackafrican indian coloured white data collected sample south african taxpayers means faceface interviews questionnaire compiled extensive review scope limited focused natural taxpayers tshwane metropolitan area includes pretoria capital city south africa gauteng purpose generalise conclusions entire south african population population groups south africa perceptions towards taxation order create positive tax culture government possibly focus strongly educating population groups importance paying taxes multifaceted needed order influence large number factors play role individual behaviour"

Limited research on taxpayers’ perceptions has been conducted in South Africa. A study was undertaken in order to determine the perceptions of South African taxpayers about various aspects with regard to taxation. There are no standardised scales to measure taxpayers’ perceptions. The reasons for evading taxes, however, have been explored by both economists and psychologists. This article elaborates on the design of a measurement tool for determining taxpayers’ perceptions taking previous research into account. In addition, this article assesses whether findings from the current research substantiates earlier research. The results of the current study confirmed the majority of findings from past research. The significance of this study is emphasised, in that it builds on previous research, utilising insights from several disciplines and various theoretical perspectives.","possible reasons tax resistance south africa customised scale measure compare perceptions previous tax resistance takes major forms namely tax avoidance tax evasion diminish governments tax receipts limited taxpayers perceptions conducted south africa undertaken order determine perceptions south african taxpayers aspects regard taxation standardised scales measure taxpayers perceptions reasons evading taxes explored economists psychologists elaborates design measurement tool determining taxpayers perceptions taking previous account addition assesses current substantiates earlier current confirmed majority past significance emphasised builds previous utilising insights several disciplines perspectives"

A qualitative comparative case study design was followed. Through the literature review in the first phase, three previously unrelated components, namely Warren's (2003) evolution of business legitimacy theory, Jensen's (2001) three descriptors of the company as an agent in society; and Holmström's (1997) social systemic Public Relations paradigm, were combined to develop a theoretical framework against which the websites and the annual and sustainability reports of three South African retailers were analysed in the second phase. Analyses were done at two levels: the degree to which community relations and governance issues were represented at strategic level and the achievement of specific impact objectives at technical level. All three retailers channelled CSR activities through either a foundation or a trust registered as a non-profit entity. This could be indicative of the importance assigned to their CRS initiatives. An ability to adapt to changes in the macro environment and surviving economic, political and social challenges was demonstrated.",""

Despite its important role, NPOs experience great difficulties, obtaining sustained funding. This paper assumes that NPOs should manage donor relationships as informed by the principles of two-way communication, with the aim of building strong and mutually beneficial relationships. However, because of NPO's lack of funding, they mostly cannot afford to appoint trained communication and relationship practitioners to manage NPO–donor relationships in order to ensure sustained funding. The purpose of the research was to determine how NPOs practice donor relationship management within their unique context and whether these NPOs’ donor relationship practices correspond with theory? It was found that NPOs intuitively practice donor relationship management according to most of the theoretical principles of relationship, management. It is recommended that NPOs stay committed to their mission, and not deviate from it only to obtain funding. Furthermore, focusing on donors’ need for self-actualisation seems to be important for continued donor support.","donor relationship management practices south african nonprofit sector importance nonprofit organisations npos south african development sector undisputed especially economic recession negatively affected governments delivery social services despite important role npos experience great difficulties obtaining sustained funding assumes npos manage donor relationships informed principles way communication aim building strong mutually beneficial relationships npos lack funding mostly afford appoint trained communication relationship practitioners manage npodonor relationships order ensure sustained funding purpose determine npos practice donor relationship management unique context npos donor relationship practices correspond npos intuitively practice donor relationship management according principles relationship management recommended npos stay committed mission deviate obtain funding furthermore focusing donors need selfactualisation seems important continued donor support"
"541",2014,"academic_review","academic","Non-profit organizations bridging the communication divide in a complex South Africa South Africa's post-apartheid governments have made remarkable progress in consolidating the nation's peaceful transition to democracy, but many South Africans still view themselves and each other according to stigmatizing categories. As the country's remarkable and peaceful transition to democracy unfolds, millions, both urban and rural, are still confronted with having to survive unemployment, homelessness, lack of basic services, HIV/Aids, food insecurity and unacceptable levels of crime and violence. Confronted by the complexity of our development challenges, one of our biggest failures is a lack of communication, trust, common purpose, collaborative leadership and sustainable relationships between the various sectors and stakeholders in development. Transforming South Africa's society to remove the legacy of marginalization will be a long-term process requiring the sustained commitment of the leaders and people of the nation's diverse groups. So the question remains: how can non-profit organizations (NPOs) establish themselves as development providers within the uncertain political arena, of which South Africa is characteristic, in order to represent all the masses who cannot speak for themselves and more than often find themselves in a marginalized and stigmatized position? Principle results Some Non-profit organizations recognize that their relationships with stakeholders is of great importance for their survival, various forms of communication take place without the necessary planning and without clear objectives for the development of these relationships. NPOs need a positive image and reputation due to financial implications where they do not have sufficient funds to support or market themselves effectively. In this climate of polarization NPOs play a pivotal role in providing a voice to the poor, mobilizing a motion of change and creating a platform for relationships, credibility and trust. Within the theoretical framework of relationship management theory, the interests of all stakeholders are balanced through the management of the stakeholder relationships. Major conclusions Non-profit organizations need to ensure that they protect their stakeholders (especially those who are in desperate need of the services rendered by these organizations), deliver better services and although not operating for the purpose of making a profit, manage themselves so that they do generate profit which will enable them to support themselves especially when funding is something that is becoming a rare phenomenon. Although NPOs find themselves in difficult financial times they need to renovate and almost reinvent themselves, in order to be fully capable to address many social problems in SA and to indicate to those who support them (especially financially) that they are to be trusted, committed to make a difference, that they deliver on their promises and to ensure open communication channels with all their stakeholders. NPOs need to manage their reputations which are built on their corporate identities because it is the organization's reputation that often creates a lifeline in uncertain times. If the NPOs succeed in managing their identities effectively, it may serve as the foundation for developing and maintaining relationships with their respective stakeholders which in turn could change the face of South Africa's society. These organizations might go about creating a platform for dialog in an attempt to build sustainable productive relationships that can go about uplifting and empowering those who would otherwise not have such an opportunity.","nonprofit organizations bridging communication divide complex south africa south africas postapartheid governments made remarkable progress consolidating nations peaceful transition democracy south africans view according stigmatizing categories countrys remarkable peaceful transition democracy unfolds millions urban rural confronted survive unemployment homelessness lack basic services hivaids food insecurity unacceptable levels crime violence confronted complexity development challenges biggest failures lack communication trust common purpose collaborative leadership sustainable relationships sectors stakeholders development transforming south africas society remove legacy marginalization longterm process requiring sustained commitment leaders people nations diverse groups question remains nonprofit organizations npos establish development providers uncertain political arena south africa characteristic order represent masses speak find marginalized stigmatized position principle nonprofit organizations recognize relationships stakeholders great importance survival forms communication take place without necessary planning without clear objectives development relationships npos need positive image reputation due financial sufficient funds support market effectively climate polarization npos play pivotal role providing voice poor mobilizing motion change creating platform relationships credibility trust framework relationship management interests stakeholders balanced management stakeholder relationships major conclusions nonprofit organizations need ensure protect stakeholders especially desperate need services rendered organizations deliver better services operating purpose making profit manage generate profit enable support especially funding something becoming rare phenomenon npos find difficult financial times need renovate almost reinvent order fully capable address social problems sa support especially financially trusted committed make difference deliver promises ensure open communication channels stakeholders npos need manage reputations built corporate identities organizations reputation creates lifeline uncertain times npos succeed managing identities effectively serve foundation developing maintaining relationships respective stakeholders turn change face south africas society organizations might go creating platform dialog attempt build sustainable productive relationships go uplifting empowering otherwise opportunity"

Despite this growth, academic research into INGO management remains limited and, due to their unique characteristics, management theories developed for for-profit organisations cannot be applied as is to INGOs. Internal communication is a critical area of management that has been proven to have a major impact on an organisation's effectiveness, particularly when managed strategically. Therefore this article explores the strategic management of internal communication within the INGO context. This study synthesised the current literature on this topic and included five case studies to understand the current state of internal communication within INGOs. It was determined that INGOs do not manage internal communication strategically. However, there is evidence that the implementation of strategic internal communication could help INGOs address several of their challenges and have an impact on their overall effectiveness.

"543",2014,"academic_review","academic","DR4 communication in the South African context: A conceptual paper Within the disaster risk reduction field the term that is used to encompass all pre- and post-disaster phases such as disaster planning, preparedness, prevention, mitigation, warning, impact, rescue, relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery (Van Niekerk, 2008, p. 367), is disaster risk reduction, response and recovery, shortly referred to as DR4. DR4 communication refers to communication, management applied during the disaster management phases. In the Hyogo Framework for Action (UN/ISDR, 2005), that calls for action to build resilience of nations against disasters, information sharing and cooperation, dialogue between parties involved in disaster management, public awareness and media relations is suggested as some of the priorities that should receive attention (UN/ISDR, 2005, p. 23). Authors, such as Wisner, Gaillard, and Kelman (2012, p. 1), also refer to the importance of communication between stakeholders and specifically the fact that disaster risk reduction requires specialist knowledge on communication management. In addition, the South African National Disaster Management Framework (SANDMF) specifically focuses on communication management and communication flow during incidences by identifying this aspect as one of the three enablers of the SANDMF (South Africa, 2005, p. 3). Communication responsibilities are even assigned to the Provincial Disaster Management Centre and Municipal, Disaster Management Centre (South Africa, 2005, pp. 13–14). Communication is thus regarded as a critical aspect of disaster management (Coombs, 2012, p. 17) and assistance with disaster communication management is needed in order to limit current problems experienced with communication in disaster risk reduction and disaster management (see International Wildland Fire Summit, 2003, Reid and Van Niekerk, 2008, p. 246). An analysis of disaster (crisis) communication literature showed that it mainly focuses on (i) pre- and post-crisis reputational communication from the profit organisation's point of view (Avery, Lariscy, Kim, & Hocke, 2010, p. 192) and (ii) on the profit organisation's expected technical reaction communication during the, crisis, i.e. who to phone to activate response agencies (Avery et al., 2010, p. 192; Littlefield et al., 2012, p. 248). From a disaster risk reduction field, the little information there is on communication, focuses on media engagement during a disaster (see Radford & Wisner, in Wisner et al., 2012, pp. 761–771; Van Niekerk, 2008, p. 362). Research on the trans-disciplinary focus of combining the disaster risk reduction and communication management fields, is lacking. This paper conceptualises DR4 communication by: Theoretically placing strategic communication management within the disaster risk reduction, and management paradigm, Defining DR4 communication; and Applying DR4 communication to the South African context. The findings indicate that appropriate disaster communication could assist to lessen the risk and aid disaster recovery (Hale, Dulek, & Hale, 2005, p. 112, 114) as communication practitioners could provide strategic information from the environment that could reduce uncertainty in strategic decision-making and ensuring that disaster management goals align with stakeholder expectations in order to save lives and limit the impact of a disaster (Grunig, 2006, p. 3, 6; Phillips, 2006a, Phillips, 2006b, p. 34, 35; Valin, 2004). Specifically in South Africa, a country where myriad of man-made disasters and 77 natural disasters (between 1980 and 2010) took place (Preventionweb, 2012), communication management has a positive role to play in disaster risk reduction.","communication south african context conceptual disaster risk reduction field term used encompass pre postdisaster phases disaster planning preparedness prevention mitigation warning impact rescue relief rehabilitation reconstruction recovery van niekerk p disaster risk reduction response recovery shortly referred communication refers communication management applied disaster management phases hyogo framework action unisdr calls action build resilience nations disasters information sharing cooperation dialogue parties involved disaster management public awareness media relations suggested priorities receive attention unisdr p wisner gaillard kelman p refer importance communication stakeholders fact disaster risk reduction requires specialist knowledge communication management addition south african national disaster management framework sandmf focuses communication management communication flow incidences identifying aspect enablers sandmf south africa p communication responsibilities assigned provincial disaster management centre municipal disaster management centre south africa pp communication thus regarded critical aspect disaster management coombs p assistance disaster communication management needed order limit current problems experienced communication disaster risk reduction disaster management see international wildland fire summit reid van niekerk p disaster crisis communication mainly focuses pre postcrisis reputational communication profit organisations point view avery lariscy kim hocke p ii profit organisations expected technical reaction communication crisis e phone activate response agencies avery et al p littlefield et al p disaster risk reduction field little information communication focuses media engagement disaster see radford wisner wisner et al pp van niekerk p transdisciplinary focus combining disaster risk reduction communication management fields lacking conceptualises communication theoretically placing strategic communication management disaster risk reduction management paradigm defining communication applying communication south african context appropriate disaster communication assist lessen risk aid disaster recovery hale dulek hale p communication practitioners strategic information environment reduce uncertainty strategic decisionmaking ensuring disaster management goals align stakeholder expectations order save lives limit impact disaster grunig p phillips phillips p valin south africa country myriad manmade disasters natural disasters took place preventionweb communication management positive role play disaster risk reduction"

The FPA works closely with several governmental stakeholders, but these stakeholders do not view the FPA as having high levels of organisational legitimacy. A lack of organisational legitimacy hinders the FPA in obtaining its organisational goals. Theoretically, a NPO's role is dependent on its values, as embodied in its vision, mission and goals statement. Managing communication strategically to build strong relationships with key governmental stakeholders should assist NPOs to obtain and maintain organisational legitimacy. The purpose of the research was to determine by means of semi-structured interviews the perceptions of the FPA and its key governmental stakeholders on the role of the FPA as well as the quality of its stakeholder relationships, and the effect of these perceptions on the FPA's perceived organisational legitimacy. The study confirmed the theoretical relationship between organisational legitimacy, strategic communication and relationship management and a clear, value-based role.

The academic field of marketing management considers customer relationship management (CRM) as most appropriate to achieve this, while communication management focuses instead on public relations (PR). The purpose of this research was to analyse theories in these two disciplines and derive an integrated theoretical framework of CRM and PR client retention. The framework was then tested through in-depth interviews with short-term insurance clients and short-term insurance providers (brokers and direct insurers) in South Africa to gain perspectives from both sides. The importance of some fundamental elements found in literature were affirmed, two elements’ importance were questioned and it was established that three inconsistencies existed between what providers regard as essential to retain clients and what clients regard necessary for them to stay in a relationship with an insurance provider. This may explain the many unsuccessful client retention efforts of South African brokers and direct insurers. Six new CRM and/or PR elements, not found in literature, are presented in the article for exploration in future research. In order to assist client retention in the very competitive short-term insurance industry, results were applied to the core tenets of Niemann's (2005) SA model for the implementation of strategic integrated communication (IC).

SSAPWs were found to have performed reasonably high on the ease of interface, while lagging in terms of disseminating useful information; ability to engage the public in constructive dialoguing (i.e. dialogic loop); conservation of visitors; and return visits. While internet penetration rates in SSA may be low and expensive, most people with internet access are underreported, as data is atypically derived from unreliable PC internet subscriptions as opposed to social media usage via mobile devices. The authors argue for more proactive public sector marketing strategies, leveraging the SSAPW platform for effective crime detection, reporting and fighting – in a collaborative effort between the police and the citizens of concerned states. In so-doing the study not only contributes to the scant literature on the potential of constructive dialogic communications on the websites of public services in the developing world context – not the least in the police service sector.

While most agree about the importance of better understanding viral marketing, there is less agreement about what makes content become viral. While some content gets viewed by millions of people, others struggle to gain viral traction. Content specific, intrapersonal and interpersonal reasons have been proposed for viral marketing success. This paper focuses on the intrapersonal reasons for content going viral in the context of political satire. More specifically, the role of emotion in the spread of content online, is investigated. Political satire focuses on gaining entertainment from politics. Satire, and specifically political satire, forms part of using humour in advertising and has been influential in shifting public opinion since ancient Greece. This study compares success and unsuccessful viral campaigns that used political satire, by first analysing the online comments that viewers made about the video. Following these findings, an experiment is conducted and the influence of intensity, creativity, humour and utility on virality is modelled, controlling for valence and previous exposure. The findings suggest that, when using political satire in viral campaigns, creativity and the intensity of the emotions felt are key influencing factors in whether videos get “shared” or “liked”. Therefore, while many authors contend that particular emotions or positive content has a greater likelihood to become viral, this paper shows that it is not the particular emotion, but the intensity with which that emotion was felt that drives viral success.","means end using political satire go viral rise video sharing giants like youtube google video coupled increased broadband connectivity improved sharing functionality social networking sites role viral video cemented imc strategies agree importance better viral marketing agreement makes content become viral content gets viewed millions people others struggle gain viral traction content intrapersonal interpersonal reasons proposed viral marketing success focuses intrapersonal reasons content going viral context political satire role emotion spread content online investigated political satire focuses gaining entertainment politics satire political satire forms using humour advertising influential shifting public opinion since ancient greece compares success unsuccessful viral campaigns used political satire analysing online comments viewers made video following experiment conducted influence intensity creativity humour utility virality modelled controlling valence previous exposure using political satire viral campaigns creativity intensity emotions felt influencing factors videos get shared liked therefore contend particular emotions positive content greater likelihood become viral shows particular emotion intensity emotion felt drives viral success"

En route to professionalism The debate on the professional status of Communication Management/Public relations1 has been high on the worldwide agenda for decades. While previous research has focused on the criteria for professionalism in this field, practitioners and academics often question the efforts of professional associations to adequately address the issue of implementing systems to facilitate professional status. The emergence of the Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management (GA) as an umbrella body for various regional professional associations, as well as the increased emphasis on regulation, standards and governance in all spheres of the global business environment, have led to renewed questions about global efforts to achieve professional status for this field. This study focused on the goals and actions of member associations of the GA in relation to the question of professional status. In order to understand the current state of affairs an exploratory qualitative approach was followed in which member associations were surveyed and their websites reviewed. The fact that fewer than half of the 27 member associations responded to the survey suggests that a study about this matter is not deemed particularly important and/or that the issue of professional status is not widely pursued. However, the associations that participated in this study agree that professional status is important. The study has also found that many similarities exist across continents in terms of the mechanisms utilized to achieve professional status. Codes of ethics, contributions to a body of the knowledge and the provision of professional training opportunities are regarded as quite important while divergent viewpoints exist in relation to issues like accreditation and a standardized tertiary curriculum.","yet en route professionalism debate professional status communication managementpublic high worldwide agenda decades previous focused criteria professionalism field practitioners academics question efforts professional associations adequately address issue implementing systems facilitate professional status emergence global alliance communication management ga umbrella body regional professional associations increased emphasis regulation standards governance spheres global business environment led renewed questions global efforts achieve professional status field focused goals actions member associations ga relation question professional status order current state affairs exploratory qualitative followed member associations surveyed websites reviewed fact fewer half member associations responded survey matter deemed particularly important issue professional status widely pursued associations participated agree professional status important similarities exist continents terms mechanisms utilized achieve professional status codes ethics contributions body knowledge provision professional training opportunities regarded quite important divergent viewpoints exist relation issues like accreditation standardized tertiary curriculum"

From propaganda to public diplomacy, the practices and activities have taken different forms and scopes, mainly including government-owned media outlets aimed at foreign audiences, state-subsidized media organizations as quasi-governmental instruments, overseas advertising and public relations campaigns designed to sway public opinion to win general support for the nation involved or to repair international relations damaged by terrorist attacks and other man-made crises, and recruiting and bribing journalists as clandestine operatives. Whether such practices have been effective in changing hearts and minds among international audiences, however, is open to debate and remains to be further explored. Within the perspective of sociology of knowledge, the main purpose of this study is to look at how China comes to be viewed as an object in international communication research over the past decades that cast the country through the prism of either propaganda or public diplomacy.","propaganda public diplomacy assessing chinas international practice image since world war ii governmentsponsored international propaganda public diplomacy become visible sophisticated countries around world china exception immune compulsion communication imperative reach woo public home abroad vested interests propaganda public diplomacy practices activities taken forms scopes mainly governmentowned media outlets aimed foreign audiences statesubsidized media organizations quasigovernmental instruments overseas advertising campaigns designed sway public opinion win general support nation involved repair international relations damaged terrorist attacks manmade crises recruiting bribing journalists clandestine operatives practices effective changing hearts minds international audiences open debate remains explored perspective sociology knowledge main purpose look china comes viewed object international communication past decades cast country prism either propaganda public diplomacy"

It also compared message strategies using a content analysis of Ministry of Foreign Affairs websites of eight countries that are recent members or candidates to join the European Union to examine how public diplomacy message strategies correlate with economic development, level of democracy, and perceptions of the country. The most common message strategy was informational. There were no statistically significant correlations between reputation and message strategy, but descriptive statistics show countries that used advocacy strategies had higher means for reputation. There was a significant correlation between the level of democracy and the use of advocacy messages. Findings indicate that transitional countries could benefit from advocacy and promotional message strategies.","comparative public diplomacy message strategies countries transition exploratory used infrastructural variables used comparative applied public diplomacy compared message strategies using content ministry foreign affairs websites eight countries recent members candidates join european union public diplomacy message strategies correlate economic development level democracy perceptions country common message strategy informational statistically correlations reputation message strategy descriptive statistics countries used advocacy strategies higher means reputation correlation level democracy use advocacy messages transitional countries benefit advocacy promotional message strategies"

Four operational hypotheses were tested using Chi-square cross tabulation. The result shows that members of the general public and professionals perceived PR messages as credible. However, members of the general public, unlike professionals, perceived the loyalty of PR professionals to be more on the side of employers and clients; the role of PR was perceived as basically oriented towards media relations; and PR profession was perceived more as a tool for repairing damaged organisational image.

"559",2014,"academic_review","academic","Blurred lines: German freelance journalists with secondary employment in public relations Nearly half of all German freelance journalists have a second job, mainly in public relations (PR). This work combination can be problematic, since journalists and PR practitioners have different responsibilities. Working as a journalist entails contributing to the public duties of journalism such as informing the public, offering multiple viewpoints, and representing societal interests; in contrast, PR practitioners must advocate solely in their clients’ interests. Conflicts can arise between these two roles if a freelance journalist is, for instance, required to critically investigate his or her PR client. However, there has been little research on freelance journalists with secondary work in PR. This study seeks to address this gap in research; therefore, we conducted a quantitative online survey among German “PR-journalists”. Our results show that nearly half of the participants take on secondary PR work for financial reasons; however, a similar number of journalists take on PR-work voluntarily, as they find the work interesting and enjoyable. Moreover, participants described their professional identity very similarly to that of German journalists in general. The PR-journalists surveyed were aware of the potential for conflicts of interest arising from their dual role. While such conflicts have been rarely encountered by those in the study sample, most participants assumed that other PR-journalists face such conflicts often, and expressed concern that these conflicts are not handled professionally.","blurred lines german freelance journalists secondary employment nearly half german freelance journalists second job mainly pr work combination problematic since journalists pr practitioners responsibilities working journalist entails contributing public duties journalism informing public offering multiple viewpoints representing societal interests contrast pr practitioners must advocate solely clients interests conflicts arise roles freelance journalist instance required critically investigate pr client little freelance journalists secondary work pr seeks address gap therefore conducted quantitative online survey german prjournalists nearly half participants take secondary pr work financial reasons similar number journalists take prwork voluntarily find work interesting enjoyable moreover participants described professional identity similarly german journalists general prjournalists surveyed aware potential conflicts interest arising dual role conflicts rarely encountered sample participants assumed prjournalists face conflicts expressed concern conflicts handled professionally"

We selectively use professionalism as an underlying theoretical framework to explore key areas of PR as a profession in Vietnam by considering the impact of environmental variables such as culture and the media system. This paper provides a current snapshot of how an industry introduced by Western multinational corporations has adapted to the Vietnamese context. Demand for PR in Vietnam is still mostly driven by multinational corporations to promote products through media relations. Many Vietnamese companies are unsure about investing in PR due to a limited understanding of what it is, misperceiving the practice as advertorial placement due to a widely entrenched “envelope culture”. We have found interpersonal relationships during and outside of official work hours are highly valued for effective PR practice, and that clients mostly rely on agencies to implement execution rather than advise on long-term strategies. Our findings underscore the need for the establishment of a professional association and more PR training courses to increase understanding about the relatively new Vietnamese PR industry and guide its future development.","vietnamese practitioners perceptions emerging field exploratory contemporary pr practice vietnam underpinned semistructured interviews senior vietnamese pr executives agencies selectively use professionalism underlying framework areas pr profession vietnam considering impact environmental variables culture media system current snapshot industry introduced western multinational corporations adapted vietnamese context demand pr vietnam mostly driven multinational corporations promote products media relations vietnamese companies unsure investing pr due limited misperceiving practice advertorial placement due widely entrenched envelope culture interpersonal relationships outside official work hours highly valued effective pr practice clients mostly rely agencies implement execution advise longterm strategies underscore need establishment professional association pr training courses increase relatively new vietnamese pr industry guide future development"

To date, the public relations literature on legal judgments has focused on cases where media channels were sued for defamation. The article uses a 2012 Israeli court decision that may be unique in ruling out defamatory intentions in a public relations plan that was part of a lawsuit. The defendant in this case was not the media but rather a company that hired a public relations firm to, according to the judgement, conduct a defamatory campaign against a competitor. Although this is just one case in one country, the article also considers some of the wider implications for the profession and for democracy.","judging israeli court judgement defamatory negative campaign analyzes recent court ruling israel argues major community internationally date legal judgments focused cases media channels sued defamation uses israeli court decision unique ruling defamatory intentions plan lawsuit defendant case media company hired firm according judgement conduct defamatory campaign competitor just case country considers wider profession democracy"

As the first study developing a multiple-item scale for measuring publics’ crisis emotions, this study examines the conceptualization and operationalization of attribution-independent crisis emotions versus attribution-dependent crisis emotions by employing two survey data sets (N = 490) for scale development and testing. Results indicate that three types of emotions are likely to be felt by publics when exposed to organizational crises: (1) attribution-independent (AI) crisis emotions; (2) external-attribution-dependent (EAD) crisis emotions; and (3) internal-attribution-dependent (IAD) crisis emotions. The scale's reliability, factorial structure, and validity are further assessed. The findings confirm that the underlying processes of publics’ emotions felt in crisis situations are different from those felt in non-crisis situations.

Particular images, like a photograph or a sound bite are found to endure as representations of defining moments of crises. This study seeks to examine the concept of an enduring image, how it is engendered and how it impacts crisis communication efforts. The study utilizes five case studies of crisis with an inherent enduring image. An enduring image constitutes a prime representation of the accused in a given crisis. These images are loaded with symbolic potential and exhibit a sense of permanence in public consciousness. Understanding the implications of an enduring image can offer insights to organizations on how to better manage one's public and media image during or after a crisis.

"567",2014,"academic_review","academic","Emotional crisis communication Organizational crises are usually highly emotional experiences for both organizations and stakeholders. Hence, crisis situations often result in emotionally charged communication between the two parties. Despite the attention of organizations and scholars to the emotions of stakeholders during crises, little is known about the effects of the emotions communicated by organizations on corporate reputations. Through the use of vignettes, this experiment reveals that besides crisis-response strategy (diminish vs. rebuild), the communicated emotion (i.e., shame and regret) has a positive effect on corporate reputation. Mediation analyses showed that this effect of communicated emotion could be explained by the public's (negative) affective as well as cognitive responses (i.e., account acceptance). This study confirms that emotional signals embedded in crisis responses may affect corporate reputations by reducing feelings of anger and by increasing the acceptance of the organizational message. In doing so, this study provides a starting point for further exploration of the effectiveness of other emotions in crisis communication.","emotional crisis communication organizational crises usually highly emotional experiences organizations stakeholders hence crisis situations result emotionally charged communication parties despite attention organizations scholars emotions stakeholders crises little known effects emotions communicated organizations corporate reputations use vignettes experiment reveals besides crisisresponse strategy diminish vs rebuild communicated emotion e shame regret positive effect corporate reputation mediation analyses effect communicated emotion explained publics negative affective cognitive responses e account acceptance confirms emotional signals embedded crisis responses affect corporate reputations reducing feelings anger increasing acceptance organizational message starting point exploration effectiveness emotions crisis communication"

"577",2014,"academic_review","academic","A reappraisal of Delphi 2.0 for public relations research This paper introduces, analyzes, and explains the Delphi method of research, particularly as it applies to the public relations industry. The Delphi technique became known some 50 years ago when the RAND Corporation used it for forecasting. Since then, scholars and forecasters have used it periodically for qualitative explorations into complex issues or domains. The overall purpose of the Delphi is to facilitate formal discussion among selected experts in a given domain around a particular topic; it is particularly useful when those experts cannot easily gather in one place. The method encourages the sharing of diverging worldviews over a few “rounds” or iterations in the hope that the views may converge into some direction around the given topic. For this reason, the Delphi has often been used in situations or environments that tend to be somewhat ambiguous and where interviews and surveys are neither timely nor appropriate. Public relations scholars started incorporating the Delphi into their research in the late 1980s, and the technique has since been employed to explore broad-ranging issues among experts on at least a dozen occasions. However, aside from these particular studies, public relations literature contains little discussion about the technique and its possible applications or implications for developing knowledge in the field. This paper, then, is intended to dissect the pros and cons of the Delphi method so as to offer guidance to public relations scholars who may wish to use it in future studies. This paper is created through a literature review of similar articles on Delphi studies in other domains, followed by an examination of some studies conducted to advance issues in public relations. The authors explore the most appropriate situations for using a Delphi and list the benefits and disbenefits of different aspects or applications of the method. They trace the evolution of Delphi research from its early roots into the era of the Internet and social media, which offer new tools for increasing the number of respondents and moving through the Delphi process more quickly than could previously be done. In advancing such an examination of the Delphi, this paper should be a useful addition to emerging public relations literature.","reappraisal delphi introduces analyzes explains delphi method particularly applies industry delphi technique became known years ago rand corporation used forecasting since scholars forecasters used periodically qualitative explorations complex issues domains overall purpose delphi facilitate formal discussion selected experts given domain around particular topic particularly useful experts easily gather place method encourages sharing diverging worldviews rounds iterations hope views converge direction around given topic reason delphi used situations environments tend somewhat ambiguous interviews surveys neither timely appropriate scholars started incorporating delphi late technique since employed broadranging issues experts least dozen occasions aside particular contains little discussion technique possible applications developing knowledge field intended dissect pros cons delphi method guidance scholars wish use future created review similar delphi domains followed examination conducted advance issues appropriate situations using delphi list benefits disbenefits aspects applications method trace evolution delphi early roots era internet social media new tools increasing number respondents moving delphi process quickly previously done advancing examination delphi useful addition emerging"

This essay explores the under-theorized relationship between ideology and public relations by examining the role of the corporate voice in public relations history. Evidence suggests that public relations counsel, serving as the corporate voice, created messages that produced and reproduced certain ideological meanings about the corporation. These ideological meanings provided important guidance on how members of the public should think about, relate to, and experience the corporation as a necessary, natural and benevolent organization in society. By incorporating ideological theory as an analytical tool to study public relations history, this article explores an important, but not often studied aspect of public relations history – the development and use of the corporate voice as a site of ideological production.","corporate voice ideology alternate history scholars us generally agree origins corporate correspond rise us industrial revolution late nineteenth early twentieth centuries essay theorized relationship ideology role corporate voice history evidence counsel serving corporate voice created messages produced reproduced certain ideological meanings corporation ideological meanings provided important guidance members public think relate experience corporation necessary natural benevolent organization society incorporating ideological analytical tool history important studied aspect history development use corporate voice site ideological production"

The expansion has parallels – a few of which we acknowledge below – in the body of historical work in the discipline. In this article, we contend that future research on PR pasts should seek to be relevant to three clusters of contemporary themes that feature strongly in mainstream history. Cluster one is the environmental context of globalization and associated geographical and social diversifications. Cluster two concerns the scale, methods, and ecological inclusiveness to engage with these changes; and, the third covers nation-centric mindsets, archival assumptions, and the impact of changing media. We also argue for PR historians resourcing the next stages of PR history from advances in historiography and history writing practices with particular attention to the point of view of the historian and awareness of the traditions and limitations, within which he, she, or they write. We suggest that this resourcing process will involve questioning assumptions of authority embedded in archive-centered PR research, decentering nation-bound narratives, re-evaluating notions of objectivity, and extending the field's temporal and spatial boundaries.","resourcing next stages pr history case historiography since start century work done expanding just content geographical methodological social range scholarship expansion parallels acknowledge body historical work discipline contend future pr pasts seek relevant clusters contemporary themes feature strongly mainstream history cluster environmental context globalization associated geographical social diversifications cluster concerns scale methods ecological inclusiveness engage changes third covers nationcentric mindsets archival assumptions impact changing media argue pr historians resourcing next stages pr history advances historiography history writing practices particular attention point view historian awareness traditions limitations write resourcing process involve questioning assumptions authority embedded archivecentered pr decentering nationbound narratives reevaluating notions objectivity extending fields temporal spatial boundaries"

PR oftentimes places its genesis in the late 19th Century corporate sphere to distance itself from press agentry.

Public relations scholarship, however, tends to focus on how corporations primarily articulated their worth through touting how the products and services they offered were constructive to society. This study, however, through a review of Mobil's “Observations” advertorials that ran from 1975 through 1980, reveals how a corporation attempted to build an influential persona by offering a corporate personality, that is an empathetic fellow traveler who is also believable and aspirational. This examination of the presence of the corporate persona points to lingering concerns, especially regarding how well the corporation can realize and communicate its corporate character in a world that is increasingly complicated by the rise of non-traditional information sources (e.g., social media), and interlocking, systemic concerns (e.g., climate change, economic/ecological sustainability). Public relations can assist in better understanding such factors so that the corporate persona can act in ways that benefit stakeholders and society.","conveying sensemaking corporate persona mobil oil observations columns since least early century corporation arisen us entity attempts help individuals make sense world use scholarship tends focus corporations primarily articulated worth touting products services offered constructive society review mobils observations advertorials ran reveals corporation attempted build influential persona offering corporate personality empathetic fellow traveler believable aspirational examination presence corporate persona points lingering concerns especially corporation realize communicate corporate character world increasingly complicated rise nontraditional information sources eg social media interlocking systemic concerns eg climate change economicecological sustainability assist better factors corporate persona act ways benefit stakeholders society"

Based on the notions of mentality and longue durée, which Le Goff inherited from the Annales movement, we propose that a nonlinear approach to the history of public relations will help to extend its time scale back to the beginnings of civilization.

The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the crisis frames of the domains align over time. To empirically analyze frame alignment, an automated semantic-network analysis is introduced to compare implicit framing among the domains. By examining press releases, news articles, and social-media manifestations of four Dutch crisis cases, the dynamic character of crisis framing became apparent. The study documents the rise of crisis-frame alignment among PR, news media, and the public over time. After frame alignment the domains’ discourses move away from one another resulting in more variation between frames. This pattern of alignment is considered to be crisis specific as a necessity to collectively make sense of a complex crisis situation. The collective sensemaking might be crucial to solve organizational crises and to avoid uncontrollable crisis magnification.","frames align interplay pr news media public times crisis focuses framebuilding process organizationalcrisis situations interplay domains pr news media public purpose investigate crisis frames domains align time empirically analyze frame alignment automated semanticnetwork introduced compare implicit framing domains press releases news socialmedia manifestations dutch crisis cases dynamic character crisis framing became apparent documents rise crisisframe alignment pr news media public time frame alignment domains discourses move away another resulting variation frames pattern alignment considered crisis necessity collectively make sense complex crisis situation collective sensemaking might crucial solve organizational crises avoid uncontrollable crisis magnification"

Public relations has not been immune from conglomerate mergers. However, the inter-related economic and structural dimensions of public relations within a conglomerate are often undermined in the relevant literature. The existing literature shows lack of studies on these dimensions. This research investigates the degree of conglomeration among the top American PR agencies and the characteristics of these conglomerated agencies. Using industrial organization theory as the theoretical framework, the findings revealed that 24% of the leading public relations agencies in the United States are part of conglomerates. These agencies tend to be located in large metropolitan areas, have a relatively small number of employees and have considerable net fees. The study also found strong and positive statistical correlations between conglomerated PR agencies when compared to un-conglomerated in variables such as agency's location, primary service and net fees.","conglomeration top american agencies case conglomerates increasing size include media industries immune conglomerate mergers inter economic structural dimensions conglomerate undermined relevant existing shows lack dimensions investigates degree conglomeration top american pr agencies characteristics conglomerated agencies using industrial organization framework leading agencies united states conglomerates agencies tend located large metropolitan areas relatively small number employees considerable net fees strong positive statistical correlations conglomerated pr agencies compared unconglomerated variables agencys location primary service net fees"

With an approach he called “creative confrontation,” Schmertz offered an adversarial stance toward the news media, coupled with inventive methods of supporting the arts. Creative confrontation sought the public's support by revealing that the corporation was an entity that understood the needs of the public and worked to uphold American values like free expression and progress.

The second highlights important issues that can arise in relationships between non-profit organizations and the commercial sponsors of their events.

"624",2015,"academic_review","academic","Perception of Russia's soft power and influence in the Baltic States This paper seeks to explore and analyse the different means and mechanisms of influence employed by Russia on the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). By influence, it means the attempt to try and get another country to behave in a manner that benefits the influencer's policy and/or interests. As such, this can entail exerting one of two forms of power, hard or soft (as defined by Nye, 2004) to bring about the compliance. The current paper restricts its focus to those mechanisms related to shaping opinion and perception, such as public diplomacy (in its various forms). To begin with the paper shall define the various concepts used – influence, power and public diplomacy. It shall then shift to the different Russian institutions that have been created to shape and manage influence, such as Russky Mir or Rossotrudnichestvo. Plus there are those other elements that exist in the region – Russian compatriots and Russian language media (both local and external to the Baltic States). Then the paper shall deal with relations between Russia and the Baltic States, with a focus upon recent history. Sources shall not be limited to academic literature and mass media resources, but will also include interviews for an ‘insider’ perspective on the issue.

Dialogue, development communication, and deontological ethics Despite being a frequently discussed topic in the public relations literature, dialogue is often misunderstood as simply two-way communication and seldom examined in practice. While international development organizations frequently claim to use dialogic and participatory methods, development communication remains a relatively unexplored area in public relations. To further clarify public relations’ understanding of dialogue as well as its potential in development practice, this study examined how a USAID-sponsored international development project adopted participatory communication practices to encourage Bolivian farmers to switch from coca to coffee. Drawing from public relations and development literature on dialogue, the article juxtaposes the approaches to “dialogue” used in the project against normative concepts of the theory. The article argues that using genuine dialogue is a matter of differentiating deontological, means-based approaches to communication practice, from consequentialist, ends-based orientations.","ends justify means dialogue development communication deontological ethics despite frequently topic dialogue misunderstood simply way communication seldom practice international development organizations frequently claim use dialogic participatory methods development communication remains relatively unexplored area clarify dialogue potential development practice usaidsponsored international development project adopted participatory communication practices encourage bolivian farmers switch coca coffee drawing development dialogue juxtaposes dialogue used project normative concepts argues using genuine dialogue matter differentiating deontological means communication practice consequentialist ends orientations"

This study investigates how Liu Xiang's withdrawal from the 2012 London Olympics and Sun Yang's unlicensed driving crisis affected their sponsorships of Nike and Beijing Hyundai, respectively. Attribution theory and the concept of in-group/out-group orientation provide a framework for examining both primary and secondary public reactions to these public relations crises on Sina Weibo. As a comparative study, this paper adopts both qualitative (thematic analysis of two official announcements) and quantitative methods (content analysis of 738 Weibo postings). Within a Chinese cultural context, evidence indicates that celebrity-endorsement crises are internally attributed and perceived to be controllable. Where primary public attitudes are concerned, integrity violations lead to more negative reactions; however, inclusion strategies find a better reception than distancing, regardless of the public's crisis-responsibility attributions. For secondary online reactions, Weibo posters’ perceptions of external locus, controllability, and integrity violations generate more “likes” than organizational strategies, thereby proving themselves more influential online. This study ultimately provides a more comprehensive refinement of attribution theory by both conceptualizing crisis-response strategies with a discussion of Chinese cultural sensitivities and offering empirical data on the ways in which primary and secondary crisis communication affects stakeholders via social media.","crossroads inclusion distance organizational crisis communication celebrityendorsement crises china celebrity endorsements though popular means communicating products carry high risks lead negative consequences organizations solicit especially endorsers find embroiled scandals crises unrelated products promote investigates liu xiangs withdrawal london olympics sun yangs unlicensed driving crisis affected sponsorships nike beijing hyundai respectively attribution concept groupgroup orientation framework primary secondary public reactions crises sina weibo comparative adopts qualitative thematic official announcements quantitative methods content weibo postings chinese cultural context evidence indicates celebrityendorsement crises internally attributed perceived controllable primary public attitudes concerned integrity violations lead negative reactions inclusion strategies find better reception distancing regardless publics crisisresponsibility attributions secondary online reactions weibo posters perceptions external locus controllability integrity violations generate likes organizational strategies thereby proving influential online ultimately comprehensive refinement attribution conceptualizing crisisresponse strategies discussion chinese cultural sensitivities offering empirical data ways primary secondary crisis communication affects stakeholders via social media"

The results indicate that organizations with a favorable pre-crisis reputation suffer less reputational loss from a crisis than organizations with an unfavorable pre-crisis reputation. The explanation for this effect is that consumers are reluctant to change their initial attitude toward an organization and therefore attribute less responsibility for a crisis to organizations with a favorable pre-crisis reputation. Finally, the findings show that the positive impact of a favorable pre-crisis reputation not only protects organizations against the harms of a crisis event, but against subsequent negative publicity and external allegations as well.","role favorable precrisis reputation protecting organizations crises investigates degree favorable vs unfavorable precrisis reputation shields organizations reputational loss due crises organizations favorable precrisis reputation suffer reputational loss crisis organizations unfavorable precrisis reputation explanation effect consumers reluctant change initial attitude organization therefore attribute responsibility crisis organizations favorable precrisis reputation finally positive impact favorable precrisis reputation protects organizations harms crisis event subsequent negative publicity external allegations"

A critical reflection Scholarship in public relations seems to be overly positive about social media. The dominant discourse in public relations is that using social media is “good”, because social media can help organizations in developing dialogs and relationships with publics and in engaging with them. Yet empirical evidence in public relations is mostly case-dependent and limited to the realm of understanding current organizational practices, with limited understanding of the concrete value for organizations or for publics. In this paper I question the utility of social media for publics, organizations and public relations, and I argue that the positive view of social media held by the majority of public relations scholars is grounded on the profession's need to reconcile the two sides of public relations identity—the rhetorical and the relational. A discussion of whether current public relations practices in social media reflect these two main identities is offered, as well as a discussion of the implications of uncritical use of social media for the public relations profession.","using social media good profession critical reflection scholarship seems overly positive social media dominant discourse using social media good social media help organizations developing dialogs relationships publics engaging yet empirical evidence mostly casedependent limited realm current organizational practices limited concrete value organizations publics question utility social media publics organizations argue positive view social media held majority scholars grounded professions need reconcile sides identity rhetorical relational discussion current practices social media reflect main identities offered discussion uncritical use social media profession"

"646",2015,"academic_review","academic","Agile public relations planning: The Reflective Communication Scrum In this paper a new, agile, method will be introduced for public relations planning. Existing planning methods all suggest that research and analysis should be the first phase, followed by strategy, smart goals and a detailed action plan, and ending with an evaluation of the results. These models provide an undesirable illusion of control. That is why this approach is no longer suitable in a digitalized society in which organizations must function in a public arena of ongoing constructions of meanings done by (self-invented) stakeholders. Consequently, the context of modern public relations is much more complex than the rusted notion of two-way communication with relevant publics implicates. That is why preference should be given to the view that communication is not so much communication between two or more actors but is a multi-way diachronic process of ongoing constructions of meanings in which one cannot foresee who is – or will be – involved, in what way, and what the results will be. To be successful, a more flexible planning method is needed in which change is a defining part during the process. Scrum is such a method. To make it applicable in public relations, this agile method, well-known in IT, needed to be expanded by supplementing theory on communication, change and reflectivity, and by enrichment of the common notion of evaluation.","agile planning reflective communication scrum new agile method introduced planning existing planning methods phase followed strategy smart goals detailed action plan ending evaluation models undesirable illusion control longer suitable digitalized society organizations must function public arena ongoing constructions meanings done selfinvented stakeholders consequently context modern much complex rusted notion way communication relevant publics implicates preference given view communication much communication actors multiway diachronic process ongoing constructions meanings foresee involved way successful flexible planning method needed change defining process scrum method make applicable agile method known needed expanded supplementing communication change reflectivity enrichment common notion evaluation"

While this can damage the reputation of an organization, effectively handling complaints also bears considerable opportunities to win back complainants and to win over observers of the interaction. This study analyzes how large companies handle complaints on their Facebook and Twitter pages. Results reveal that the companies are not fully embracing the opportunities of social media to demonstrate their willingness to interact with and assist their stakeholders. Organizational responsiveness is only moderate, and companies often try to divert complainants away from the social network site. The most frequently applied response strategy is asking complainants for further information which does not appease complainants. Response strategies that foster complaint satisfaction are used less often. They comprise offering a corrective action, connecting the complainant with someone who can provide a problem solution and thanking the complainant.","handling complaints social network sites complaints complaint responses facebook twitter pages large us companies social media numerous possibilities consumers stakeholders voice complaints organizations public damage reputation organization effectively handling complaints bears considerable opportunities win back complainants win observers interaction analyzes large companies handle complaints facebook twitter pages reveal companies fully embracing opportunities social media demonstrate willingness interact assist stakeholders organizational responsiveness moderate companies try divert complainants away social network site frequently applied response strategy asking complainants information appease complainants response strategies foster complaint satisfaction used comprise offering corrective action connecting complainant someone problem solution thanking complainant"

A quantitative methodology was applied to perform this research. A population of 2710 professionals from 43 European countries working on different hierarchical levels both in communication departments and agencies across Europe were surveyed as part of a larger transnational online survey.

This reduction is a conceptual shortcoming. In order to fully understand how digital media impact on society and the communication landscape, our conceptualisation needs to include new entertainment media, especially computer games. Interactivity here might mean interaction with the AI (artificial intelligence) or human players or both, but the crucial difference lies in the fact that the interaction takes place in a ‘world’ created by the software. Despite the discussion about ‘gamification’ in marketing and a tradition of game studies in the humanities, there have been few attempts to treat computer games not only as trivial culture, but as a “persuasive device”, as a way to shape public opinion. This article explores how the theory of procedural rhetoric, as outlined by Ian Bogost, enhances our understanding of this growing area.","missing media procedural rhetoric computer games discussion new digital media focuses mainly social media reduction conceptual shortcoming order fully digital media impact society communication landscape conceptualisation needs include new entertainment media especially computer games interactivity might mean interaction ai artificial intelligence human players crucial difference lies fact interaction takes place world created software despite discussion gamification marketing tradition game humanities attempts treat computer games trivial culture persuasive device way shape public opinion procedural rhetoric outlined ian bogost enhances growing area"

Public relations practitioners have recognized the power of these tools and have adopted them. Through social media they instantly post information to the public and the possibility of accessing to this information anytime they need and ability to prove authenticity of this information is very important for any of them. This paper discusses the value of information posted by public relations practitioners on social media and the need for the short and long-term preservation of such information. Based on our research, which was conducted across 24 national archives within the European Union, we collected important information on how to prepare organizations and their public relations practitioners for various issues surrounding the preservation of important information and allowing for its acquisition when necessary. The conclusion provides recommendations and guidelines for the preservation and acquisition of authentic public relations records transmitted to the public via social media.","acquisition preservation authentic information digital age rapid technological development shifted society digital age social media tools indispensable daily life practitioners recognized power tools adopted social media instantly post information public possibility accessing information anytime need ability prove authenticity information important discusses value information posted practitioners social media need short longterm preservation information conducted national archives european union collected important information prepare organizations practitioners issues surrounding preservation important information allowing acquisition necessary conclusion recommendations guidelines preservation acquisition authentic records transmitted public via social media"

The challenge, then, is how to identify a broader range of potential recipients—or a larger public. Rather than the non-existent general public, the authors propose the term “latent diffused publics”—a term that combines the theoretical work of James Grunig and the linkages of Esman from the 1970s. The latent element of this type of public suggests that the public is out there ready to respond, but will not do so until triggered by a message. The diffused aspect refers to a public that is difficult or impossible to identify until it responds to the message. We believe that identifying a potential new type of public is more realistic as we move deeper and deeper into the era of social media communication.","digital publics tracking reaching social media reached point general public challenge identify broader range potential recipients larger public nonexistent general public propose term latent diffused publics term combines work james grunig linkages esman latent element public public ready respond triggered message diffused aspect refers public difficult impossible identify responds message believe identifying potential new public realistic move deeper deeper era social media communication"

It suggests that the microblogging service plays a specific role in allowing them to monitor public opinion and current affairs, to interact with voters, journalists, stakeholders and other politicians and to disseminate information. The way politicians use Twitter is influenced by concerns of impression management (content and style of tweets), and also various institutional, political and social/symbolic limits, which contribute to reveal tensions between the field of French politics and the way it has shaped traditional political communication practises on the one hand, and the technical and social characteristics associated with Twitter on the other. While these characteristics may be factors encouraging politicians to adopt the microblogging platform as a PR tool, they also constitute challenges in terms of PR.",""

An example of this is philosopher Benedict of Spinoza's ideas on the power of images and the importance of emotions to explain human behavior. This article delves into how Spinoza's ideas have been transmitted to classic public relations authors such as Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays through the works of their masters and their mentors: George Santayana, who was one of Lippmann's philosophy professors at Harvard, and Sigmund Freud, an uncle of Bernays whose psychoanalysis theory shaped Bernays’ approach to persuasion. In contrast to these public relations masters of persuasion who had a pessimistic view of the human condition, Spinoza's Ethics is based on a positive anthropology of man that squares well with contemporary and more ethical relationship-building approaches to public relations.","searching benedict de spinoza history communication influence walter lippmann edward bernays ideas crucial development communication field contemporary classical philosophical thinking example philosopher benedict spinozas ideas power images importance emotions explain human behavior delves spinozas ideas transmitted classic walter lippmann edward bernays works masters mentors george santayana lippmanns philosophy professors harvard sigmund freud uncle bernays whose psychoanalysis shaped bernays persuasion contrast masters persuasion pessimistic view human condition spinozas ethics positive anthropology man squares contemporary ethical relationshipbuilding"

However, organizations with operations in more than one country are confronted with differences in geography, culture, politics, economy, communication, and demands for transparency that make finding an appropriate balance difficult. This study defines and documents the criteria used by global public relations agencies in consulting with MNCs to determine whether and how to localize strategies and tactics in host countries. Specifically, in-depth interviews of 25 senior-level public relations professionals at the leading global agencies were conducted to understand their views about the localization process. Responses from these interviews were used to develop a five-step decision-making model for localization. This model demonstrates the process that global agencies use to consult with MNCs about localization. The five steps encompass evaluations of the need to localize, the ability of MNCs to localize, the extent to which MNCs should localize, the tactics that could be localized, and the metrics to evaluate the success of localization efforts.","tipping balance decisionmaking localization global agencies global scholarship conceptualized standardization localization ends continuum need balanced achieve organizational efficiency effectiveness organizations operations country confronted differences geography culture politics economy communication demands transparency make finding appropriate balance difficult defines documents criteria used global agencies consulting mncs determine localize strategies tactics host countries depth interviews seniorlevel professionals leading global agencies conducted views localization process responses interviews used develop step decisionmaking localization demonstrates process global agencies use consult mncs localization steps encompass evaluations need localize ability mncs localize extent mncs localize tactics localized metrics evaluate success localization efforts"

Robert D. Putnam’s widely recognized conceptualization of social capital suggests that civic engagement behaviors serve as surrogate measures of social capital. Results of the current research support such a social capital approach to public relations. Data indicated public relations professionals are more likely to participate in civic engagement behaviors than the general U.S. population, and differences were found between public relations roles (manager/technician) for three researcher-created subcategories of civic engagement behaviors: political involvement, participation in voluntary organizations, and personal interaction.

The Mandate contains a proposition on how public relations professionals and professional bodies might better represent and promote their roles. The Mandate was created following a five-stage iterative process: first, a brainstorming session by GA Board members; second, a global survey of leaders of professional bodies identifying their opinions on issues requiring advocacy with key stakeholders such as business leaders, politicians, journalists and the public. Analysis of the 280 responses led to stage three, a three-strand ‘prospectus’ for discussion by the global public relations community. This led fourthly, to research and discussion by three global groups co-led by an academic and a practitioner drawn from the GA Board and from the pool of recognised leaders in the profession. These groups developed the three strands producing a draft Mandate which was then debated online before being discussed, in stage five, by 800 practitioners and academics attending the World Public Relations Forum in Melbourne, Australia in November 2012. Using face-to-face interactions, additional online observations, an on-site, online application and hard copy comments, the Mandate was refined and finalised in Melbourne. The Mandate identifies three critical roles for professionals: defining organisational character and values; building a culture of listening and engagement; and the fulfilment of responsibility in all its dimensions. The results offer an interesting representation of roles which can be seen as essentially normative, but which, examples demonstrated, are being enacted by some leading practitioners. The paper critically examines whether the Mandate furthers the GA's declared mission to advance the profession, and goes on to analyse both the process by which it was generated and the content. Among other topics the paper discusses whether the Melbourne Mandate could be proposed as a genuine attempt to capture the best representations of the practice and promote these for the benefit of the profession globally. Alternatively, it could be regarded as largely a distillation of the ambitions of the professions’ elite since the process was led by and largely shaped by them. It could also be argued as a further attempt at imposing western norms on a profession whose non-western members are under-represented in such initiatives (Gregory & Halff, 2013). The paper concludes with observations on the value of such initiatives.","practitionerleaders representation roles melbourne mandate critically melbourne mandate global alliance advocacy platform developed global alliance ga umbrella organisation representing professional associations practitioners worldwide mandate contains proposition professionals professional bodies might better represent promote roles mandate created following stage iterative process brainstorming session ga board members second global survey leaders professional bodies identifying opinions issues requiring advocacy stakeholders business leaders politicians journalists public responses led stage strand prospectus discussion global community led fourthly discussion global groups coled academic practitioner drawn ga board pool recognised leaders profession groups developed strands producing draft mandate debated online stage practitioners academics attending world forum melbourne australia november using faceface interactions additional online observations site online application hard copy comments mandate refined finalised melbourne mandate identifies critical roles professionals defining organisational character values building culture listening engagement fulfilment responsibility dimensions interesting representation roles seen essentially normative examples demonstrated enacted leading practitioners critically mandate furthers gas declared mission advance profession goes analyse process generated content topics discusses melbourne mandate proposed genuine attempt capture best representations practice promote benefit profession globally alternatively regarded largely distillation ambitions professions elite since process led largely shaped argued attempt imposing western norms profession whose nonwestern members represented initiatives gregory halff concludes observations value initiatives"

It analyses the representation of public relations in HBO's television series, True Blood, focusing on the campaign to pass the Vampire Rights Amendment run by American Vampire League.

Instead, multiple discourses of public relations invite the audience to engage critically with public relations concepts and meaning-making.

Findings include an empirical confirmation of the low level of research activity on public affairs; that stakeholder and rhetorical theories have been the most widely used theories, but are far from constituting dominant paradigms; that scholarship has privileged functional objectives over civic concerns; and that published work originates almost entirely from institutions in Europe and the US with the Global South invisible.

The paper includes an integrated literature review of contemporary text and theories on storytelling from academics and industry leaders relating to the benefits of using corporate stories; corporate stories and employee engagement; employee engagement and enhanced internal reputation; the link between internal and external reputation; the benefits of PR strategies to CSR; and the limitations of corporate storytelling. Results from a 2012 Australian corporate survey on the use of storytelling are also integrated into the review. Many theorists endorse corporate storytelling as a valuable medium for engaging with employees and improving internal reputation. However, both contemporary academic and industry analysis appears limited in acknowledgement of a link between internal storytelling and improved CSR. The paper draws a link between using corporate stories to engage more deeply with staff in order to strengthen internal loyalty and effect a stronger external reputation, as organisations seek to heighten their CSR credibility and make employees their reputation champions.

This paper explores these issues from the dual perspectives of sociologist Erving Goffman's (1922–1982) reflections on the performance of work and Carl Jung's (1875–1961) concept of Persona, the socially acceptable face of the individual or group. The former explores these issues through observation of external behaviours, the latter by engaging with the psyche. Goffman and Jung, despite their conflicting worldviews, offer a complementary understanding of the operation, internal and external, of professional identity. The paper, which is conceptual and interpretive, with the objective of building theory, summarises contemporary approaches to professional identity in public relations and other fields, before introducing Goffman, who is often mentioned in this context, and Jung, who is not. Together these two scholars offer insights into the interior and exterior aspects of identity, which is here applied to public relations, raising questions both about the production of identity as a commodity for others and the production of self-image of public relations practitioners. The introduction of Jungian thinking brings the inward or experiential dimension of professional identity to this debate.","performance persona goffman jungs professional identity applied work involves shaping reflecting communicating identity organisations individuals turn shaped professional identity field individual practitioners issues dual perspectives sociologist erving goffmans reflections performance work carl jungs concept persona socially acceptable face individual group former issues observation external behaviours latter engaging psyche goffman jung despite conflicting worldviews complementary operation internal external professional identity conceptual interpretive objective building summarises contemporary professional identity fields introducing goffman mentioned context jung together scholars insights interior exterior aspects identity applied raising questions production identity commodity others production selfimage practitioners introduction jungian thinking brings inward experiential dimension professional identity debate"

"715",2015,"academic_review","academic","Public relations’ “Relationship Identity” in research: Enlightenment or illusion Public relations’ identity in research sets parameters that can limit or illuminate the field. In this paper we consider how public relations have been developing a “relationship identity” in research. General public relations research, as opposed to sub-disciplines such as crisis communication, is dominated by a relationships approach. The focus on relationship was designed to enlighten public relations research and even improve the practice. But has the emphasis on relationships and focus on the organization–public relationship (OPR) as an outcome really enlightened public relations research? This paper explores four concerns about the application: (1) problems associated with applying a concept from interpersonal communication to public relations, (2) how identities affect the formation of close relationships, (3) the value of close relationships for publics, and (4) the parasocial nature of organization–public relationships.

Toward an economically informed understanding of public relations The notion of public relations contributing to the fabric of society is heavily contested in the public sphere and under-researched by the academy. The authors of this paper propose that the study of the relevance of public relations to society can be enlightened by turning to economics. Using information asymmetry as a framework, the argument is that public relations can be analyzed as a social institution that both helps to mitigate market imperfections and consequently increases the efficiency with which society’s resources are allocated as well as the chances for more market participants to derive value out of economic transactions.","society economically informed notion contributing fabric society heavily contested public sphere researched academy propose relevance society enlightened turning economics using information asymmetry framework argument analyzed social institution helps mitigate market imperfections consequently increases efficiency societys resources allocated chances market participants derive value economic transactions"

The chapter concludes with challenges for practitioners, individually and as a profession, to increase self-awareness, an essential prerequisite for ethical practice. It takes an interpretive approach, drawing on literature from Jungian scholarship, organisational psychology and moral philosophy. These explorations are developed at book-length in Fawkes (2014. Public relations ethics and professionalism: The shadow of excellence. London and New York, NY: Routledge), but here the focus is on practice and practitioners’ access to conscience through consciousness. After a brief summary of the Jungian psyche and the role of consciousness in activating conscience, this paper suggests questions and reflections for the profession and its constituent practitioners. This discussion is strongly linked to developing an ethical attitude (Solomon (2001).

Through theoretical consideration as well as interviews of representatives of public relations and marketing communication associations and agencies in Finland, the article presents the practitioners’ perceptions and experiences using the literature on transparency. To better understand the communicative organization of today in the context of hybrid content creation, we propose the concept of the “transparent communicative organization.” We suggest four new propositions for the practice of hybrid forms of engaging publics to support the transparent communicative organization: (1) source identification to enable trust, (2) two-way transparency inviting user feedback, (3) stakeholder-centric arenas to enable engagement, and (4) content on organizational expertise to build long-term engagement.

A comparative overview of the concept of dialogue The concept of dialogue has always been a mainstay in the research literature on public relations. However, the fields of corporate communication and, more recently, business management have focused on different aspects of the notion. Despite such increased research interest, the concept of dialogue yields a range of analytical perspectives; this is due in part to the fragmentation of academic study, whereby scholars pursue parallel lines of inquiry that never intersect in interdisciplinary exchange. Therefore, the twofold purpose of this article is to explore the concept of dialogue in the context of business: on the one hand, to offer an interdisciplinary account of dialogue based on a model of analysis shaped by the five key dimensions of the concept; and on the other hand, to use the model to trace which perspectives are articulated in the related theory. In short, the article works towards a clearer understanding of the management implications that stem from the conceptualization of dialogue.","reinventing wheel comparative overview concept dialogue concept dialogue always mainstay fields corporate communication recently business management focused aspects notion despite increased interest concept dialogue yields range analytical perspectives due fragmentation academic whereby scholars pursue parallel lines inquiry never intersect interdisciplinary exchange therefore twofold purpose concept dialogue context business hand interdisciplinary account dialogue shaped dimensions concept hand use trace perspectives articulated short works towards clearer management stem conceptualization dialogue"

These co-constructions of what it means to live in Singapore and what it means to be a citizen in that country were part of a research project to answer the call by critical political observers in Singapore to expand the space for ideas and perspectives regarding Singapore other than those from the governing elite. Led by a critical culture sensibility for theorising from below, the author spoke with 25 teenagers from troubled backgrounds, and analysed and interpreted the conversations using constructivist grounded theory. Fourteen categories emerged from the corpus, with negotiating becoming the core category articulating all 14 categories, and accounting for the dialectical relations amongst the categories as well as the discontinuities between the categories and the dominant nation building narrative as embodied in the Singapore Story. The core category instantiates the discursive empowerment of the youth. The suggestion is to open up discursive spaces for marginalised voices. Public relations, in its capacity for listening and co-construction, can play a nation building role that goes beyond managing information campaigns.","constructing nation negotiating outcome using grounded presents representations nation group risk youth residing welfare homes coconstructions means live singapore means citizen country project answer call critical political observers singapore expand space ideas perspectives singapore governing elite led critical culture sensibility theorising author spoke teenagers troubled backgrounds analysed interpreted conversations using constructivist grounded fourteen categories emerged corpus negotiating becoming core category articulating categories accounting dialectical relations amongst categories discontinuities categories dominant nation building narrative embodied singapore story core category instantiates discursive empowerment youth suggestion open discursive spaces marginalised voices capacity listening coconstruction play nation building role goes beyond managing information campaigns"

Understanding how city reputation – a key intangible good- is constructed is an important challenge for academics and a range of other stakeholders. Politicians and officials seek to position and manage their cities in ways that win legitimacy and trust for themselves and prosperity for their citizens and other stakeholders. This study develops understanding of the concept of city reputation through a multi-methods empirical study of two medium-sized Spanish cities where earlier research has shown there are gaps between government performance (as attested to by performance data on a series of city services), city communicators’ accounts of their communication strategies and policy priorities and citizens’ perceptions of their cities’ reputation and performance. Based on semi-structured interviews and focus groups, the reasons for these gaps are explored. The paradox of a less wealthy Malaga more content with the information it receives from its government and a more wealthy Vitoria critical of what citizens consider the government's self-congratulatory messages, suggests that more research should be carried out to understand both how government communication can achieve a better balance between information and persuasion and the importance of expectations and perceptions in citizens’ satisfaction with government communication and governments themselves.","mind gap local government communication strategies spanish citizens perceptions cities cities become chief place residence work majority worlds citizens engines regions prosperity city reputation intangible good constructed important challenge academics range stakeholders politicians officials seek position manage cities ways win legitimacy trust prosperity citizens stakeholders develops concept city reputation multimethods empirical mediumsized spanish cities earlier shown gaps government performance attested performance data series city services city communicators accounts communication strategies policy priorities citizens perceptions cities reputation performance semistructured interviews focus groups reasons gaps explored paradox wealthy malaga content information receives government wealthy vitoria critical citizens consider governments selfcongratulatory messages carried government communication achieve better balance information persuasion importance expectations perceptions citizens satisfaction government communication governments"

In South Africa, given the country's history, changed and new conversations are needed even though dialogue across ethnic, social and political divides does not come naturally. Despite celebrating 20 years of democracy, South Africans still face many economic, social and moral challenges. These challenges manifest themselves through protest actions against the slow pace of improvement in the townships, frustration with lack of personal progress among young South Africans and a lack of tolerance and understanding of the “others” (Seekings, 2007). Unfortunately, change takes time and concerted effort (Eyre & Littleton, 2013); trust must be built and is earned through participation in open dialogue and mutual negotiation (Bardhan, 2011, p. 97).

In their examination of these campaigns the authors discern the following trends in best practices: social media campaigns employ digital storytelling techniques that are both immersive and emotive, and that promote various forms of content sharing; these stories involve members of the target audience in at least one form of open-ended offline engagement that involves sharing behaviors; the content is optimized for mobile displays and controls; and, finally, the content is timely. The authors conclude that, although marketers think of social media in terms of brand awareness and reputation management, the effective use of social media in Public Relations campaigns can generate conversion, facilitate brand positioning, and maintain continued brand sustenance. The authors conclude that the effective use of social media is disrupting the PR campaign cycle: the role of campaign events to generate publicity in service to a PR campaign may, in the future, be displaced by social media campaign tactics which belong to an entirely different ecosystem where the act of sharing social media content generates publicity in lieu of a campaign event.","social media lessons effective cases employs collective case examination awardwinning campaigns conducted variety social media platforms order determine best practices near term trends effective use social media examination campaigns discern following trends best practices social media campaigns employ digital storytelling techniques immersive emotive promote forms content sharing stories involve members target audience least form openended offline engagement involves sharing behaviors content optimized mobile displays controls finally content timely conclude marketers think social media terms brand awareness reputation management effective use social media campaigns generate conversion facilitate brand positioning maintain continued brand sustenance conclude effective use social media disrupting pr campaign cycle role campaign events generate publicity service pr campaign future displaced social media campaign tactics belong entirely ecosystem act sharing social media content generates publicity lieu campaign event"

The fundamental assumption behind the normative relationship-building role of public relations is that relationships among organizations and publics are mutually beneficial. However, some network theories (e.g., structural holes theory) prescribe that maintaining many organizational relationships is inefficient, instead suggesting that organizations should occupy a powerful network position by separating and controlling the flow of information between others. Under such theories, power comes in the form of tertius gaudens (the third who benefits at the expense of others). In this article we argue that such an approach to power in public relations is manipulative and unethical, and offer an alternative approach via the concept of tertius iungens (the third who joins others), which endorses connecting organizations and emphasizes the collective good.","social networks power tertius iungens cocreational studying relationship networks important roles professionals building relationships fundamental assumption behind normative relationshipbuilding role relationships organizations publics mutually beneficial network eg structural holes prescribe maintaining organizational relationships inefficient instead suggesting organizations occupy powerful network position separating controlling flow information others power comes form tertius gaudens third benefits expense others argue power manipulative unethical alternative via concept tertius iungens third joins others endorses connecting organizations emphasizes collective good"

"743",2016,"academic_review","academic","Going for the jugular in public diplomacy: How adversarial publics using social media are challenging state legitimacy Traditionally, nations have viewed other nations as their primary competitors in public diplomacy (PD). In a quest to increase their effectiveness, states are applying relationship management and pursuing a more relational PD approach with publics. However, present understanding of relationships may be one-sided, focusing primarily on the state's relationship-building activities and overlooking the public's agency in defining relations. This paper uses relationalism as an analytical lens to construct a 4-quadrant model of public diplomacy based on the relational dynamics between a state and publics. The model reveals a parallel evolution of communication technology and public diplomacy initiatives that move from assumptions of no relations with publics, to favorable relations, to adversarial relations. A case study from Turkey is used to illustrate how diverse groups can use social media to form unlikely alliances to become a fluid, adversarial public capable of ‘going for the jugular’ and challenging state legitimacy. Aggressive separation tactics by the state to counter adversarial publics can inadvertently create a ‘relational paradox’ that leaves the two parties more politically divided and yet more relationally intertwined. The study implications stress the need for states to monitor their relational dynamic with publics as a precursor for developing reflective strategies.","going jugular public diplomacy adversarial publics using social media challenging state legitimacy traditionally nations viewed nations primary competitors public diplomacy pd quest increase effectiveness states applying relationship management pursuing relational pd publics present relationships sided focusing primarily states relationshipbuilding activities overlooking publics agency defining relations uses relationalism analytical lens construct public diplomacy relational dynamics state publics reveals parallel evolution communication technology public diplomacy initiatives move assumptions relations publics favorable relations adversarial relations case turkey used illustrate diverse groups use social media form unlikely alliances become fluid adversarial public capable going jugular challenging state legitimacy aggressive separation tactics state counter adversarial publics inadvertently create relational paradox leaves parties politically divided yet relationally intertwined stress need states monitor relational dynamic publics precursor developing reflective strategies"

The findings of the research suggest that the 100,000 Strong Foundation, as the network builder, has successfully established channels to mobilize resources through opportunity recognition, information arbitrage, and innovativeness creation.

An examination of public relations and journalism codes of ethics In a fully functioning society, citizens need information about economic, social, and political issues. The news media perform this function. Citizens also need to engage in relationships with all sorts of economic, social, and political organizations. Public relations helps to create, maintain and change these relationships. Journalism and public relations are the foundation of a fully functioning society. This article explores the extent to which journalism and public relations professionals share foundational values. We compare the codes of ethics from 33 countries (66 public relations and journalist associations) looking for both convergence and divergence in ethical values. Our findings suggest that the two professions share core values such as professionalism, expertise and moral standards. The codes agree on the individual qualities that encourage professionals to act ethically. The codes diverge, however, on each profession's view of its role in society. Journalists continue to emphasize duty to the public in their codes of ethics whereas many public relations codes focus on duty to the client or organization. Yet, this study found an evolving set of ethical codes in public relations that brings public relations and journalists closer together acknowledging their communitas roles in a fully functioning society","ethical convergence divergence communitas examination journalism codes ethics fully functioning society citizens need information economic social political issues news media perform function citizens need engage relationships sorts economic social political organizations helps create maintain change relationships journalism foundation fully functioning society extent journalism professionals share foundational values compare codes ethics countries journalist associations looking convergence divergence ethical values professions share core values professionalism expertise moral standards codes agree individual qualities encourage professionals act ethically codes diverge professions view role society journalists continue emphasize duty public codes ethics whereas codes focus duty client organization yet evolving set ethical codes brings journalists closer together acknowledging communitas roles fully functioning society"

Using William L. Benoit’s theory of image repair as its framework, this analysis considers Frémaux’s responses to accusations of sexism in the Festival’s film selection process. A close reading of articles appearing in English-language newspapers, and entertainment trade publications and websites from 2010 through 2015, reveals that Frémaux has used a variety of strategies including denial, reducing offensiveness, differentiation, and transcendence. The analysis finds that Frémaux's efforts have been largely ineffective in repairing his image due to a lack of mortification, no promise of corrective action, and claims that are revealed to be inaccurate and uninformed.",""

This study addresses that gap through surveying U.S. citizen journalists on their views of public relations professionals and their materials. Study findings point to ambivalence among citizen journalists: they are not sure of the value of public relations people or the usefulness of their material, but they voice a positive regard for public relations people the more they interact with them.

"769",2016,"academic_review","academic","From humble inquiry to humble intelligence: Confronting wicked problems and augmenting public relations This study seeks to upgrade the concept of humble inquiry into humble intelligence (HI) to address a particular set of seemingly intractable challenges known as wicked problems. It locates the concept of wicked problems in the academic literature to underpin its argument that, because of their ubiquity within organizations and across communities, wicked problems have implications for the practice of PR. It suggests that many of PR’s functional challenges within organizations can be characterised as “wicked,” while the discipline’s strategic interests suggest PR has a wider role to play in helping society address other “wicked” dilemmas. Despite these issues and opportunities the article identifies how PR has yet to recognize, let alone engage systematically with the challenges conceptualized as wicked problems. To confront them, the article sets out Schein’s notion of humble inquiry and upgrades it to humble intelligence, loosely defined as a cluster of multiple and interacting capabilities that, in concert, forge a form of collective intelligence amongst a wide range of stakeholders. In this coalition, HI can harness the dispersed knowledge that exists in communities and organizations to go beyond traditional, hierarchical, and, often, isolated forms of expertise. This reorientation engages wicked problems productively by deploying multiple perspectives, extending networks, and building the social capital required for collaboration. The article concludes that as well as gaining traction on seemingly intractable challenges, HI both complements and adds value to dialogic theories of PR.","humble inquiry humble intelligence confronting wicked problems augmenting seeks upgrade concept humble inquiry humble intelligence hi address particular set seemingly intractable challenges known wicked problems locates concept wicked problems academic underpin argument ubiquity organizations communities wicked problems practice pr prs functional challenges organizations characterised wicked disciplines strategic interests pr wider role play helping society address wicked dilemmas despite issues opportunities identifies pr yet recognize let alone engage systematically challenges conceptualized wicked problems confront sets scheins notion humble inquiry upgrades humble intelligence loosely defined cluster multiple interacting capabilities concert forge form collective intelligence amongst wide range stakeholders coalition hi harness dispersed knowledge exists communities organizations go beyond traditional hierarchical isolated forms expertise reorientation engages wicked problems productively deploying multiple perspectives extending networks building social capital required collaboration concludes gaining traction seemingly intractable challenges hi complements adds value dialogic pr"

Research provided here builds upon previous research in organizational communication and NGOs by supporting the use of social media messages as functions of information, community and action. The current study provides a more nuanced examination of those functions and establishes an affective classification within the information function to help foster social change by LGBTI asylum-specific NGOs. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the conventional public relations measures of cognitive learning, affective responses and resulting behaviors are manifested within these online functions as well.

This article focuses on the editors of these corporate publications, who must take into account the rules and norms of two different fields of professional activity, and looks at the extent to which custom publishing is journalistic. Therefore, we analyze the self-conception of the editors' professional role, the extent to which their day-to-day work is journalistic, and the role of truth in their reporting. To this end, a quantitative survey of custom publishing editors in Germany was carried out.","journalism quantitative survey custom publishing editors germany custom publishing production content edited journalistic manner organizations fastgrowing professional field located intersection journalism corporate organizational publications form strategic communication assist organizations image cultivation aim communicate particular interests stylistic optical thematic composition resemble journalistic publications readers expect unbiased objective reporting focuses editors corporate publications must take account rules norms fields professional activity looks extent custom publishing journalistic therefore analyze selfconception editors professional role extent dayday work journalistic role truth reporting end quantitative survey custom publishing editors germany carried"

Some of these changes are leading to convergence of genre and practices as well as the technologies of media. This analysis focuses on the first two of these types of convergence, drawing on data from the first Asia Pacific Communication Monitor, a survey of 1200 PR and communication practitioners in 23 Asia Pacific countries. This reveals a major shift from the traditional PESO model of media use by organizations (paid, earned, shared, owned) to an emerging SOEP model (shared, owned, earned, paid).

The experimental study (N = 233) tests this CSR dilemma model by using three CSR disclosures of a commodity trading company as the stimuli, ranging from low to high communicated CSR engagement.

However, the reality is that Israeli public relations (PR) practitioners are engaged in promotion of paid digital content marketing (DCM) without full disclosure or transparency on various internet sites. Three major questions are therefore raised and discussed: (a) Does payment for content – which entails PR practitioners control over content – demand a review of PR practice definitions? (b) Does PR paid DCM makes “give-and-take relationships” with journalists and the “two-way symmetric model” redundant in digital channels? (c) What are the ethical implications of using paid DCM without full disclosure for PR practitioners and brand stakeholders? We suggest that definitions of PR should be reviewed in light of using undisclosed paid DCM. Moreover, we claim that the penetration of PR into buying digital media, and thus purchasing control in the same way as advertising, contributes to an ambiguous line between PR and advertising. From an ethical perspective, when paid DCM is embedded into our main digital information channels, often hiding commercial messages, readers may be confused between editorial and paid content generated by marketers. This confusion may well lead to a decline in the trustworthiness of media organizations and business organizations using this practice.","practice paid content practical propositions ethical focuses relatively new marketing phenomenon embedded paid content reality israeli pr practitioners engaged promotion paid digital content marketing dcm without full disclosure transparency internet sites major questions therefore raised payment content entails pr practitioners control content demand review pr practice definitions b pr paid dcm makes givetake relationships journalists way symmetric redundant digital channels c ethical using paid dcm without full disclosure pr practitioners brand stakeholders definitions pr reviewed light using undisclosed paid dcm moreover claim penetration pr buying digital media thus purchasing control way advertising contributes ambiguous line pr advertising ethical perspective paid dcm embedded main digital information channels hiding commercial messages readers confused editorial paid content generated marketers confusion lead decline trustworthiness media organizations business organizations using practice"

Our findings suggest that despite normative claims from CSR departments that downplay the importance of public relations in the design and implementation of CSR programmes, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise. In this context, our findings show important operational deficiencies and accountability deficits precisely because of the lack of public relations input in the design and implementation of these programmes.","reluctant talk reluctant listen professionals involvement csr programmes spain contributions professionals make towards corporate social responsibility csr programmes discussing issues obstacles face enter professional area looked top publicly owned companies spain called included semistructured interviews interpretative official documents reports despite normative claims csr departments downplay importance design implementation csr programmes empirical evidence otherwise context important operational deficiencies accountability deficits precisely lack input design implementation programmes"

Consistent with previous findings about the distinctions between the conceptual devices of foreign news and foreign policy news, the focus of CCTV's foreign policy news coverage on the U.S. and East Asia indicated China's regionalized foreign policy design, while the increasing soft news in its foreign news coverage implied CCTV's inclination to tap the audience demands.

The literature review echoes the changing media landscape from the PR practitioner’s point of view: Whereas the 20th century gave birth to different kind of media relations, the highly networked and fluid ways of content re-production, dissemination and therefore the co-construction of meaning became much more important for all kinds of organizations and their public relations practitioners as well as marketeers. Referring to these new forms of mediatized content, the final section of the literature review introduces the concept of strategic mediatization as a new practice supplementing and/or replacing old media relations. Based on the theoretical ground stressed out in the literature review, an empirical study was carried out based on a quantitative survey among 2253 communication practitioners across Europe. The survey results emphasize a strong shift from the prevalence of mass media to owned media especially in Western and Northern Europe. However, the rising importance of new content practices is considered important in all European regions alike. Nevertheless, the study identifies large gaps between the considered importance and the usage of these new media relations practices.","dawn new golden age media relations pr professionals interact mass media use new collaboration practices reviews status media relations europe reflects upcoming media shift mass mediated communication produced delivered content strategic communicators review echoes changing media landscape pr practitioners point view whereas century gave birth kind media relations highly networked fluid ways content reproduction dissemination therefore coconstruction meaning became much important kinds organizations practitioners marketeers referring new forms mediatized content final section review introduces concept strategic mediatization new practice supplementing replacing old media relations ground stressed review empirical carried quantitative survey communication practitioners europe survey emphasize strong shift prevalence mass media owned media especially western northern europe rising importance new content practices considered important european regions alike nevertheless identifies large gaps considered importance usage new media relations practices"

In spite of their differences, the growing dependence of both professions on each other once again raises the question of how journalists and public relations professionals perceive and evaluate each other. Here, we examine various elements of this complex relationship. Our research was aimed towards answering two main questions. First, we conducted a correlation analysis between the level of (dis)satisfaction with working conditions of each group and their perceptions about the other profession. We expected these correlations to be negative and significant, but this did not prove to be true. In spite of the conventional wisdom that there is a love-hate relationship between the two professions, this study shows that maybe it is time to reevaluate this assumption. Second, we used the coorientational model to analyze the perceptions and cross-perceptions of journalists and public relations experts on their role in organizational reputation building. Both professional groups showed pluralistic ignorance of the other side. It also seems public relations specialists underestimate journalists’ opinion of the communication profession. They seem to perceive the relationship as more adversarial than it really is. Our results fall in line with some of the more recent studies on the journalist–public relations relationship and actually suggest that there are fewer differences between the two groups than assumed.","journalists specialists coorientational journalists professionals difficult interdependent always complicated relationship spite differences growing dependence professions raises question journalists professionals perceive evaluate elements complex relationship aimed towards answering main questions conducted correlation level dissatisfaction working conditions group perceptions profession expected correlations negative prove true spite conventional wisdom lovehate relationship professions shows maybe time reevaluate assumption second used coorientational analyze perceptions crossperceptions journalists experts role organizational reputation building professional groups pluralistic ignorance side seems specialists underestimate journalists opinion communication profession seem perceive relationship adversarial really fall line recent journalist relationship actually fewer differences groups assumed"

This is very much due to the processes of mediatization; that is to say, the double-sided process through which media (a) emerge as an autonomous institution with its own set of rationalities that other institutions adapt to; and (b) become an integrated part of other institutions’. A second assumption is that the extent to which public agencies adapt to media varies between different types of organizations, mostly as a consequence of an organization’s management structure. Public agencies governed by career managers are more eager to get media attention and control the media image of their organizations compared to agencies governed by field professionals. Circumstances that position public relations at the centre within agencies governed by career managers, but with limited freedom of action. This raises a number of questions concerning circumstances, motives and consequences for public relations and in this paper we suggest three propositions for how we can understand the interplay between media in its institutional form, public agencies and public relations (1) public relations professionals have limited control to what degree public agencies adapt to the media logic (2) public relations professionals have limited control over public agencies media activities due to their high level of formalization and standardization (3) public relations in public agencies is to an extensive degree limited to media activities.","much ado media public agencies wake managerialism rests assumption media much communication channel organization take media consideration want conditions public agencies activities much due processes mediatization say doublesided process media emerge autonomous institution set rationalities institutions adapt b become integrated institutions second assumption extent public agencies adapt media varies organizations mostly consequence organizations management structure public agencies governed career managers eager get media attention control media image organizations compared agencies governed field professionals circumstances position centre agencies governed career managers limited freedom action raises number questions concerning circumstances motives consequences propositions interplay media institutional form public agencies professionals limited control degree public agencies adapt media logic professionals limited control public agencies media activities due high level formalization standardization public agencies extensive degree limited media activities"

Companies are (i) transforming into producers of owned media and media content, and (ii) through their owned media, managing communication with stakeholders, which is (iii) significantly altering the role of corporate public relations. In the context of a case study of a company from the financial sector, the paper brings together three concepts – communication power, mediatization, and strategic communication – toward a new conceptual framework for assessing the characteristics of the communication dimension of modern companies. Such an analytical position enables the phenomenon of mediatization to be analyzed both in its historical dimension and structural dimension.","mediatization companies factor communication power new role seeks analyze mediatization companies argues companies entering new phase mediatization longer evident adaptation logic mass media now involves incorporation media logic companys media practices communication structure companies transforming producers owned media media content ii owned media managing communication stakeholders iii significantly altering role corporate context case company financial sector brings together concepts communication power mediatization strategic communication new conceptual framework assessing characteristics communication dimension modern companies analytical position enables phenomenon mediatization analyzed historical dimension structural dimension"

"808",2016,"academic_review","academic","The emerging “field” of public relations in China: Multiple interplaying logics and evolving actors’ inter-relations While public relations (PR) scholars have increasingly criticized the privilege of organizational interest, limited research has problematized the dominant analytical locus of organizational site. As a consequence, our understanding of the complexity and fluidity of PR in wider socio-cultural contexts has been constrained. To combat this shortcoming, this paper invokes the notion of “field” from institutional theory to examine how the field of Chinese PR is socially constructed, negotiated and contested by a range of actors based on their shared or competing logics and contingent inter-relations. Data were mainly collected through 48 in-depth interviews with PR agency consultants, in-house PR practitioners, journalists and industrial regulators as well as through complementary documents. The results indicate that studying PR as a socially constructed field can refresh extant PR scholarship by providing a dynamic and relational account of PR practices, and by reflecting the multifaceted interaction among various institutional actors.","emerging field china multiple interplaying logics evolving actors interrelations pr scholars increasingly criticized privilege organizational interest limited problematized dominant analytical locus organizational site consequence complexity fluidity pr wider sociocultural contexts constrained combat shortcoming invokes notion field institutional field chinese pr socially constructed negotiated contested range actors shared competing logics contingent interrelations data mainly collected depth interviews pr agency consultants house pr practitioners journalists industrial regulators complementary documents studying pr socially constructed field refresh extant pr scholarship providing dynamic relational account pr practices reflecting multifaceted interaction institutional actors"
"809",2016,"academic_review","academic","Public relations practice in the emerging ‘powerhouses’ of South East Asia: Some views from within Much has been written and theorized about public relations practice and the ways in which practitioners view themselves and their work. But little of the available international research has embraced the worldviews and perspectives of practitioners operating in the rapidly developing countries of South East Asia, which include Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation, its sister state, Malaysia, the nearby international business hub, Singapore, the increasingly vigorous yet still tightly controlled one-party state of Vietnam, the business-friendly but politically fragile Thailand, and Asia’s only majority Christian nation, the Philippines. The broad social, political, economic and cultural diversity to be found among these major member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) arguably may have important implications for the ways in which public relations programs should be conducted in these locations. This paper reports on a doctoral research project conducted among public relations practitioners working across the ASEAN region, giving glimpses into how successful operators in these locations view their work, their working environments and the challenges they face in seeking to balance sensitive considerations of localism, regionalism and globalism in increasingly fluid cross-cultural environments. The concerns they report confirm some general observations around ‘cultural difference’ raised previously in other quarters, but also highlight more strongly some particular pre-occupations including sensitivities around political power, personal values conflicting with the values of clients, employers and target publics, the importance of understanding local linguistic issues, the distinctiveness of local media systems, and pressures arising from rapidly increasing pace of life in countries of the region. The paper argues that local and regional issues of this nature deserve greater recognition by public relations scholars as a step toward the development of more truly inclusive international theories and models over time.","practice emerging powerhouses south east asia views much written theorized practice ways practitioners view work little available international embraced worldviews perspectives practitioners operating rapidly developing countries south east asia include indonesia worlds populous muslim nation sister state malaysia nearby international business hub singapore increasingly vigorous yet tightly controlled party state vietnam businessfriendly politically fragile thailand asias majority christian nation philippines broad social political economic cultural diversity major member countries association south east asian nations asean arguably important ways programs conducted locations reports doctoral project conducted practitioners working asean region giving glimpses successful operators locations view work working environments challenges face seeking balance sensitive considerations localism regionalism globalism increasingly fluid crosscultural environments concerns report confirm general observations around cultural difference raised previously quarters highlight strongly particular preoccupations sensitivities around political power personal values conflicting values clients employers target publics importance local linguistic issues distinctiveness local media systems pressures arising rapidly increasing pace life countries region argues local regional issues nature deserve greater recognition scholars step development truly inclusive international models time"

However, there has been less attention paid to the way journalists adapt to ‘spin’ culture and interpret truth once they become parliamentary media advisers. Based on inductive analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews with twenty-one Australian journalists who made the transition to parliamentary media advising, this paper offers a typology of ten subtle approaches to truth telling adopted by these journalists in their new role as political media advisers. The interview data revealed a range of pragmatic approaches including: ‘triage’, ‘putting the best foot forward’, ‘never tell a lie’, ‘playing a dead bat’, and ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’. Through the comparative insights of journalists who have worked as parliamentary media advisers, the practitioner reflections in this paper complicate the blunt conception of the mendacious ‘spin-doctor’ and point to the malleability of ‘truth’ in both communications roles.","ten shades truth australian journalists shift political pr use manipulative overt covert spin tactics parliamentary media advisers embellish obfuscate evade documented attention paid way journalists adapt spin culture interpret truth become parliamentary media advisers inductive depth semistructured interviews twenty australian journalists made transition parliamentary media advising typology ten subtle truth telling adopted journalists new role political media advisers interview data range pragmatic triage putting best foot forward never tell lie playing dead bat ask tell comparative insights journalists worked parliamentary media advisers practitioner reflections complicate blunt conception mendacious spindoctor point malleability truth communications roles"

"822",2016,"academic_review","academic","The co-evolution of public relations and journalism: A first contribution to its systematic review There are many research findings and some theoretical models regarding the interaction between journalism and public relations (PR). But only scarce research has been done so far on the historical perspective of this relationship, which is also called co-evolution of PR and journalism. The aim of this article is to make a first step into the analysis of this co-evolution with a focus on the emergence of PR in the German-language area and based mainly on German literature about the history of PR. The analysis shows that the rise of PR in the second half of the 19th century was, amongst others, a reaction to the development of journalism that had become increasingly biased. Thus, for many societal actors and organisations, the barriers to entering the public arena were increasing. At the same time the importance of the mass media, and pressures on social protagonists and organisations to legitimise their interests in a changing society, were growing. These results support a theoretical concept that describes the development of mass communication as a process of rationalisation of societal communication, which in addition can be linked with system theory.","coevolution journalism contribution systematic review models interaction journalism pr scarce done far historical perspective relationship called coevolution pr journalism aim make step coevolution focus emergence pr germanlanguage area mainly german history pr shows rise pr second half century amongst others reaction development journalism become increasingly biased thus societal actors organisations barriers entering public arena increasing time importance mass media pressures social protagonists organisations legitimise interests changing society growing support concept describes development mass communication process rationalisation societal communication addition linked system"

It argues that such a historical paradigm is contradicted by thorough archival research and needs to be revised. In fact the origins of PR activities can be traced back as far as the 1900s, having evolved initially under the terms of propaganda and press relations, with no apparent influence from the United States (U.S.). The specific term and the concept of PR arrived in Portugal only in the 1910s and matured from the 1930s to the late 1940s. They were first imported from the U.S., where in 1915 a Portuguese professor witnessed the PR activities carried out by the agricultural system. However, the modern concept, theory and practice of PR were mostly influenced by the United Kingdom (U.K.). The connecting link was The Anglo-Portuguese Telephone Co. Ltd. (APT), which pioneered the development of PR in Portugal. It directly benefited from the PR work that Basil Clarke did for a British pressure group whose chairman also managed APT. Regarding PR historiography this paper reinforces the thesis that PR developed in Europe independently from the U.S. tradition and long before World War II. It also places Portugal among the first European countries where PR emerged.","roots portugal changing old paradigm roots pr portugal last decades consensually placed late early argues historical paradigm contradicted thorough archival needs revised fact origins pr activities traced back far evolved initially terms propaganda press relations apparent influence united states us term concept pr arrived portugal matured late imported us portuguese professor witnessed pr activities carried agricultural system modern concept practice pr mostly influenced united kingdom uk connecting link angloportuguese telephone co ltd apt pioneered development pr portugal directly benefited pr work basil clarke british pressure group whose chairman managed apt pr historiography reinforces thesis pr developed europe independently us tradition long world war ii places portugal european countries pr emerged"

As Twitter has emerged as a major digital PR tool for politics over the last decade, it provides a text to examine political candidates’ PR strategies. Focusing on the cases of the two then-front runners for the 2016 U.S. presidential election – Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the present study examines differences in the ways in which they self-present and communicate with voters through their websites and Twitter. Content analysis of their websites and sampled tweets (N = T295, C228) reveals significant differences in their emphasis on traits and issues, main content of tweet, main source of retweet, multimedia use, and the level of civility. While Clinton emphasizes her masculine traits and feminine issues more than her feminine traits and masculine issues, Trump gives more weight to masculine issues, paying no particular attention to his traits. The differences were found consistently on their websites and on Twitter. Trump utilizes user-generated content as sources of his tweets significantly more often; while three quarters of Clinton’s tweets are original content, half of Trump’s tweets are retweets of and replies to citizens.

Through survey research with more than 400 educators and practitioners, this study provides evidence that the majority of practitioners and educators believe this is public relations’ responsibility. In addition, the results reveal that accredited public relations practitioners are more likely to say they feel prepared to do so, and are more likely to offer ethics counsel than practitioners who are not accredited. The study also provides insights into some of the ethical issues that practitioners are most likely to face, what types of ethics training they have received, and their roles in promoting an ethical workplace.","accredited vs nonaccredited accreditation impacts perceptions readiness ethics counsel scholars industry trade suggested practitioners ethics counsel debated degree practitioners accept role ethical conscience survey educators practitioners evidence majority practitioners educators believe responsibility addition reveal accredited practitioners likely say feel prepared likely ethics counsel practitioners accredited insights ethical issues practitioners likely face ethics training received roles promoting ethical workplace"

This has been done to study the crash of AirAsia’s flight QZ8501, in which a three-step methodological case study approach has been employed. First, a quantitative content analysis was conducted in order to identify AirAsia’s (the sender) crisis-response strategy. Second, a semantic-network analysis was applied to analyse the response from the public (the receiver). Third, an extension of this semantic-network analysis was used to analyse to which extent the framing of AirAsia’s online crisis communication had been aligned with the public framing of the crash. The results of the first step indicated that AirAsia predominately used an informational strategy (e.g., Adjusting Information). Moreover, the findings of the second and third steps revealed that there was an absence of frame alignment between AirAsia’s response strategy and the public’s response.

First, an expert review determined the fit between the CSR initiatives presented in the news articles and the core business of the organizations pursuing these initiatives. Second, a quantitative content analysis measured tone and framing of the news articles. The results reveal that while CSR fit does not influence tone, it does partly impact the framing of the media coverage, as CSR fit leads to a positive framing of organizations and their CSR activities. However, vice versa, CSR misfit does not necessarily lead to a negative representation of organizations and their CSR in the media coverage.

More attention is overdue, particularly for the conceptual pressure the ‘sharing economy’ is exerting on the public relations function. The authors propose a reconceptualization of public relations by identifying the constitutive aspects of the sharing economy and bringing together the explanatory concepts ‘circuits of commerce’ and ‘viable matches’ from economic sociology and communicative constitution of organizations theory to develop the notions of ‘deliberate disintermediation’ and ‘circuits of communication’ in public relations. The contention is that by doing this, communicative acts not only contribute meaning in the sharing economy, but have economic value. Furthermore, the sharing economy poses challenges to the traditional forms of organizing public relations functions, but offers opportunities to realize different potential when public relations facilitates circuits of communication and becomes a meta-communicative competence embedded within the organization.","sharing economy spite macroeconomic impact called sharing economy nearly complete dearth contributions communication academy discourse attention overdue particularly conceptual pressure sharing economy exerting function propose reconceptualization identifying constitutive aspects sharing economy bringing together explanatory concepts circuits commerce viable matches economic sociology communicative constitution organizations develop notions deliberate disintermediation circuits communication contention communicative acts contribute meaning sharing economy economic value furthermore sharing economy poses challenges traditional forms organizing functions opportunities realize potential facilitates circuits communication becomes metacommunicative competence embedded organization"

Scholarly literature supports the notion that social media has changed the speed at which we communicate, as well as removed traditional (geographical) boundaries around cross-cultural campaigns. Since the introduction of digital media, the role of the public relations practitioner has become more strategic in order to maintain relevance with even more diverse − and dispersed − audiences. Large scale campaigns, like the Human Rights Campaign to support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) rights, have seen messages spread far beyond the country of origin, and with that, demonstrate the ability to affect advocacy campaigns in other countries. The authors argue that instead of acting as cultural intermediaries, public relations practitioners must become cultural curators, with the skills to create meaning from audiences, who are now content creators in their own rights, and encourage a true participatory environment that sees cultural values shared as part of an organic exchange process.",""

This study examines the CSR activities of several Multinational Corporations in Indonesia, in particular how they adjust/adapt to the local wisdom in their efforts to attain their CSR goals. The main theory applied in our study is the Symbolic Convergence Theory, supported by the Accommodation Communication Theory. Three Multinational Corporations in Indonesia were chosen as subjects of this research. Analysis is based on the Collaborative Social Responsibility Model (Kartikawangi, 2015) and Cross Cultural Communication Competence in Business Interaction models (Kartikawangi et al., 2016). At present “positive” actions are increasing by companies in efforts to better understand the society they are working in. Clearer understandings of local, regional and national societal factors are required to enhance the corporation’s product development programs, marketing strategies, and CSR strategies. Local, regional and national societal groups are in positions to choose what should be provided by the companies in achieving shared and practical Symbolic Convergence meanings. The societal groups actively present their aspirations, but also the aspirations and local wisdom that must be absorbed by the company. Symbolic Convergence in the relationship is built by all interacting parties. These interactions include the companies, government and local society.

It draws on a recent major global study that was sponsored by the former Research Foundation of the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC). Analyzing the results from interviews with 26 Chief Communication Officers (CCOs) located in each of the five continents and from a survey sample of some 278 CCOs based in organizations headquartered across the globe, the study found quite notable variations in the type of departmental structures. No one dominant structural model emerged. In effect, each organization appeared to adopt a structural design to suit their individual circumstances, although there were nevertheless some reasonably common component functional elements within each department. CCOs identified those variables that they believed most influenced the design of the public relations department structure. While recognizing department structure is situation dependent, the evidence suggests that CCOs create hybrid structures unique to the circumstances. What was perhaps most surprising was that department structure did not appear to be strongly influenced by department size, other than in terms of the vertical structural design. In short, there do not appear to be any common formulas or prescribed solutions for how organizations should or do orchestrate the design of the public relations department structure, rather CCOs appear to be able to exercise a degree of latitude in determining what works best for them.","structure communication department global reports core program focused structure communication departments draws recent major global sponsored former foundation international association business communicators iabc analyzing interviews chief communication officers ccos located continents survey sample ccos organizations headquartered globe quite notable variations departmental structures dominant structural emerged effect organization appeared adopt structural design suit individual circumstances nevertheless reasonably common component functional elements department ccos identified variables believed influenced design department structure recognizing department structure situation dependent evidence ccos create hybrid structures unique circumstances perhaps surprising department structure appear strongly influenced department size terms vertical structural design short appear common formulas prescribed solutions organizations orchestrate design department structure ccos appear able exercise degree latitude determining works best"

As Europe imposes new data protection laws and incorporates the right to be forgotten that promotes censorship through search engine de-linking, United States constitutional law scholars ponder the implications of World Wide Web censorship, while journalists and public relations professionals struggle to understand how accurate transparent communication could occur in an ecosystem that allows for arbitrary information removal and the creation of memory holes. This article explains why the European notion of the right to be forgotten challenges U.S. constitutional law and professional public relations ethics, imperiling the online marketplace of ideas and eroding disclosure of information. The European Data Protection Directive and recent right to be forgotten movements directly conflict with the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment and professional communications ethics codes. The First Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights indicates the specific rights of citizens to freedom from government intervention into freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Recent actions by Google to honor European requests to remove data upon request collide with First Amendment theoretical concepts and contemporary constitutional law. Both the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) and the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) construct ethical principles for members that call for the active promotion of the free flow of information and the ethical disclosure of information. The European Data Protection Directive’s right to be forgotten silences these core professional communication ethics and more significantly imperils the robust information exchange in a global society, ultimately altering the discourse and debate in democratic countries. This paper addresses the status of the right to be forgotten in the United States and indicates how adopting such a provision in the United States would violate First Amendment theories, as evidenced by the Marketplace of Ideas Theory, the Meiklejohnian Theory, and the Absolutist Theory, and would counter traditional public relations ethics codes, conducted in a context of dialogic ethics that calls for adherence to core values advocating for transparency, disclosure, and free flow of information.","european right forgotten challenge united states constitutions amendment professional ethics explains european right forgotten violates free flow information society evidenced conflicts united states constitution ethical principles professional communicators worldwide europe imposes new data protection laws incorporates right forgotten promotes censorship search engine delinking united states constitutional law scholars ponder world wide web censorship journalists professionals struggle accurate transparent communication occur ecosystem allows arbitrary information removal creation memory holes explains european notion right forgotten challenges us constitutional law professional ethics imperiling online marketplace ideas eroding disclosure information european data protection directive recent right forgotten movements directly conflict us constitutions amendment professional communications ethics codes amendment us bill rights indicates rights citizens freedom government intervention freedom expression freedom press recent actions google honor european requests remove data upon request collide amendment concepts contemporary constitutional law society america prsa international association business communicators iabc construct ethical principles members call active promotion free flow information ethical disclosure information european data protection directives right forgotten silences core professional communication ethics significantly imperils robust information exchange global society ultimately altering discourse debate democratic countries addresses status right forgotten united states indicates adopting provision united states violate amendment evidenced marketplace ideas meiklejohnian absolutist counter traditional ethics codes conducted context dialogic ethics calls adherence core values advocating transparency disclosure free flow information"

"857",2017,"academic_review","academic","Why values matter – how public relations professionals can draw on moral foundations theory This paper will explain why corporate public relations practitioners need to draw on the role values play in how people weigh up issues, brands, and claims—and how this knowledge can lead to more powerful and resonant communications. Understanding the role of values in driving attitudes and behaviors is crucial for four reasons: The new polarized, politicized, and value-driven public information environment requires corporate communicators and other public relations professionals to understand how people’s identity and values hardwire their decisions and actions. In this environment, information alone is not enough to change opinion. Facts and figures are often dismissed or are rejected when they go against people’s sense of identity or existing values, making connecting to deep-seated motivations crucial. Communicators needs to explore what is in the background of people’s opinions—not just the foreground. They must go beyond an over-reliance on rational responses to direct questions and an obsession with dry metrics. Mapping out rational opinions against nonconscious values unearths more textured insights and communication strategies. The communications sector needs to play a rapid catch-up game with marketing, which grasp the role of motivation and identity in informing people’s attitudes, and are pioneering more effective methods to get a rounded perspective on how we act. Coming out of psychology, moral foundations theory, with its focus on how people’s core values inform attitudes and decisions, provides a powerful analytic and interpretative framework to understand and navigate this new polarized and political environment.","values matter professionals draw moral foundations explain corporate practitioners need draw role values play people weigh issues brands claims knowledge lead powerful resonant communications role values driving attitudes behaviors crucial reasons new polarized politicized valuedriven public information environment requires corporate communicators professionals peoples identity values hardwire decisions actions environment information alone enough change opinion facts figures dismissed rejected go peoples sense identity existing values making connecting deepseated motivations crucial communicators needs background peoples opinions just foreground must go beyond reliance rational responses direct questions obsession dry metrics mapping rational opinions nonconscious values unearths textured insights communication strategies communications sector needs play rapid catch game marketing grasp role motivation identity informing peoples attitudes pioneering effective methods get rounded perspective act coming psychology moral foundations focus peoples core values inform attitudes decisions powerful analytic interpretative framework navigate new polarized political environment"

In doing so, I was initially tempted to respond with a “how to”, but instead asked myself a fundamental question: “Who is communicating with whom, and why? ” The reason I pose this question is because we need to take stock of our assumptions and the perspectives we take as communication scholars and practitioners. As we face the new opportunities and challenges of global, highly mobile, and increasingly diverse and digitally savvy publics, we also need to clarify some of our assumptions. To expound on this, I will touch on the global, mobile and multicultural context; then discuss how inclusion must be combined with a focus on diversity, and conclude with a call for practitioners communicating across, within and between cultures to advocate for social change.","communicating cultures inclusion social change reflections theme special issue recent world forum communication cultures initially tempted respond instead asked fundamental question communicating reason pose question need take stock assumptions perspectives take communication scholars practitioners face new opportunities challenges global highly mobile increasingly diverse digitally savvy publics need clarify assumptions expound touch global mobile multicultural context discuss inclusion must combined focus diversity conclude call practitioners communicating cultures advocate social change"

A psychological and sociological approach to the challenge of conflicting expectations The paper enquires into the role of self-deception in public relations struggling with discrepancies between heterogeneous stakeholder expectations and organizational interests and particularly between normative expectations of truthfulness and practical temptations of deception. Drawing on theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology and sociology, we propose a framework for the origins, drivers, and functions of self-deception in public relations. The analysis reveals that under specific conditions self-deception can be an essential mechanism in public relations because it relieves practitioners from tensions driven by conflicting perceptions of truth and legitimacy. Self-deception is most likely to occur in situations of cognitive dissonance for practitioners to balance internal information processing and in situations of normative pressure when practitioners seek to comply with external expectations.","selfdeception psychological sociological challenge conflicting expectations enquires role selfdeception struggling discrepancies heterogeneous stakeholder expectations organizational interests particularly normative expectations truthfulness practical temptations deception drawing foundations evolutionary psychology sociology propose framework origins drivers functions selfdeception reveals conditions selfdeception essential mechanism relieves practitioners tensions driven conflicting perceptions truth legitimacy selfdeception likely occur situations cognitive dissonance practitioners balance internal information processing situations normative pressure practitioners seek comply external expectations"

However, reflecting a broader tendency in crisis communication to emphasize the study of response strategies at the expense of other factors, sports crisis communication research has not examined the unique factors in sports that prevent crises from causing severe image and reputation damage. In this paper, we apply Coombs’ notion of buffers to argue for new attention to two particularly important buffers in sports: communities and political economy. These buffers often preclude the need for any response at all, and crisis communication practitioners would do well to implement them around their own sports teams to prevent damage from crises.","preventing damage psychology crisis communication buffers organized sports sports crisis communication growing field focusing image repair athletes teams fan solidarity crises role mass new media crisis development reflecting broader tendency crisis communication emphasize response strategies expense factors sports crisis communication unique factors sports prevent crises causing severe image reputation damage apply coombs notion buffers argue new attention particularly important buffers sports communities political economy buffers preclude need response crisis communication practitioners implement around sports teams prevent damage crises"

In this context, a national survey was conducted among 805 respondents, with three purposes. First, this case study aimed to explore how Belgians deal with the threat by examining if they change their behavior in public places and seek information about the threat. Second, we investigated why people seek and process information about the terrorism threat based on three determinants, namely their level of involvement with the threat, the expert efficacy of the government, and attitudes towards mass media communication. Finally, this study elaborated on perceived governmental efficacy, researching how governmental reputation is affected through institutional trust and governmental responsibility. The results show that the terrorism threat leads citizens to be more alert in public places and participate less in mass events. Moreover, one fifth stopped traveling by public transport. It was found that Belgian citizens also searched for information several times a day, mostly via traditional media such as television and radio. Furthermore, based on structural equation modelling, we found that information seeking and processing behavior is determined by the cognitive assessment of the risk. This cognitive risk assessment is in turn positively influenced by risk involvement and perceived governmental expert efficacy. However, if the mass media are seen to focus too much on drama and sensationalism then the perception of risk decreases, and this in turn reduces information seeking behavior. In addition, results show that a perception of governmental expert efficacy is able to increase trust and decrease the level of governmental responsibility, which is in turn beneficial for governmental reputation. The implications of these findings are discussed.","terrorism threat belgium resilience belgian citizens protection governmental reputation means communication november terrorism threat belgium confronted citizens government situation characterized high uncertainty context national survey conducted respondents purposes case aimed belgians deal threat change behavior public places seek information threat second investigated people seek process information terrorism threat determinants namely level involvement threat expert efficacy government attitudes towards mass media communication finally elaborated perceived governmental efficacy researching governmental reputation affected institutional trust governmental responsibility terrorism threat leads citizens alert public places participate mass events moreover fifth stopped traveling public transport belgian citizens searched information several times day mostly via traditional media television radio furthermore structural equation modelling information seeking processing behavior determined cognitive assessment risk cognitive risk assessment turn positively influenced risk involvement perceived governmental expert efficacy mass media seen focus much drama sensationalism perception risk decreases turn reduces information seeking behavior addition perception governmental expert efficacy able increase trust decrease level governmental responsibility turn beneficial governmental reputation"

However, different women’s stories—as well as men’s stories who are not part of the standard White, heterosexual, American experience—are severely underrepresented in public relations practice and research. This review of research from the past 11 years shows that the practice has significant room to grow in terms of welcoming and providing a successful, equitable workplace environment to practitioners from marginalized groups. Specifically, research about the experiences of women of color, LGBT practitioners, practitioners with disabilities, practitioners aged 55 and older, and international practitioners are imperative to understand why public relations continues to be a “lily-white” field of women. To this point, research needs to seriously engage in intersectional research that links diverse practitioners’ experiences with negative outcomes (e.g., salary gaps, relegation to technical positions, etc.) and positive effects (e.g., role modeling, entrepreneurship, etc.) for the field and individual practitioners alike. Directions for future research and practical application include examining eurocentrism and systemic racism in the academic and professional fields, overcoming issues of conducting quantitative research as well as issues of valuing qualitative research, linking diversity initiatives to core public relations concerns like crises and corporate social responsibility, exploring other fields’ responses to diversity issues, and obtaining external audits by advocacy groups.","lilywhite field women state workforce diversity practice state womens strong womens stories mens stories standard white heterosexual american experience severely underrepresented practice review past years shows practice room grow terms welcoming providing successful equitable workplace environment practitioners marginalized groups experiences women color lgbt practitioners practitioners disabilities practitioners aged older international practitioners imperative continues lilywhite field women point needs seriously engage intersectional links diverse practitioners experiences negative outcomes eg salary gaps relegation technical positions etc positive effects eg role modeling entrepreneurship etc field individual practitioners alike directions future practical application include eurocentrism systemic racism academic professional fields overcoming issues conducting quantitative issues valuing qualitative linking diversity initiatives core concerns like crises corporate social responsibility fields responses diversity issues obtaining external audits advocacy groups"

At the beginning of the War, Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel received instructions from the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to return to Paris and assist the Spanish embassy in various types of counterintelligence and propaganda work. As part of this, Buñuel organized and assembled footage of the Republicans. Unlike other productions compiled in Spain, the Republican propaganda films made in Paris were generally addressed at audiences in different European countries with the aim of breaking the doctrine of non-intervention in the conflict, and they reflect Buñuel’s theories and conception of the documentary films. These films represent good examples of ethical propaganda and their aim was more informative than manipulative. From this standpoint, and in accordance with other research on public relations discourse and film, we argue that the films supervised by Buñuel in this period, and especially the most noteworthy documentary España leal en armas (1937), are examples of public relations films in wartime.",""

Despite the pharma industry's ever-increasing share in framing media coverage of health issues, the strategies used in its press materials have not yet been systematically examined. This study uses framing theory to explore the PR strategies and tactics employed by pharmaceutical companies to promote their products in Israel, where DTCA is banned. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative content analysis, we examined 1548 pharmaceutical press releases. The Israeli example can serve as a case study for understanding how the pharma industry operates in many countries around the world where DTCA is banned.

The four main strategies identified in this study are third party technique, disease branding, drug branding and Astroturfing.

Investigating implicit frames in press releases and financial newspaper coverage during the German banking crisis This study investigates the interrelation of implicit frames in press releases by the two largest German banks (Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank) and the German financial media from 2007 until 2013. Findings suggest that an increase in the salience of certain frames in press releases by German banks resulted in a decrease of that same frame in the financial media the subsequent months. Furthermore, time series analyses indicate that the banks adopted frames that were present in the media the previous month. The results imply a resistance of German financial media towards the frames used by Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank.","reciprocal influence investigating implicit frames press releases financial newspaper coverage german banking crisis investigates interrelation implicit frames press releases largest german banks deutsche bank commerzbank german financial media increase salience certain frames press releases german banks resulted decrease frame financial media subsequent months furthermore time series analyses banks adopted frames present media previous month imply resistance german financial media towards frames used deutsche bank commerzbank"

It aims at determining if strategic orientation predominates in the services for which these agencies are hired. As it has been found, some of them focus their business on this perspective. Nevertheless, there is a higher volume of technical services, such as free press and journalistic media relations. The increase in services in recent years has been due, among other reasons, to the good moment of Colombian economy. The reasons for hiring an agency are its prestige and reputation. However, this result contrasts with the argument presented by the interviewed executives as the main impediment to their practice as consultants: the lack of knowledge of their work on the part of clients.","strategic orientation communications consulting firms colombia reports conducted group ceos communication consulting agencies colombia aims determining strategic orientation predominates services agencies hired focus business perspective nevertheless higher volume technical services free press journalistic media relations increase services recent years due reasons good moment colombian economy reasons hiring agency prestige reputation result contrasts argument presented interviewed executives main impediment practice consultants lack knowledge work clients"

Western embassies were more likely to have Twitter accounts and demonstrated more average followers, but a CEE account (the Polish embassy in the United States) had the highest influencer score. A content analysis of 482 tweets brought together relevant literature from public diplomacy and public relations scholarship. A significant association was found between the diplomatic approaches and public relations message strategies, thus identifying a relationship between disciplines that are frequently considered separately. With regard to public diplomacy strategies, Western embassies engaged primarily in advocacy, whereas CEE embassies engaged primarily in cultural diplomacy. Listening was the least likely approach to be taken by both Western and CEE embassy accounts. With regard to public relations strategies, Western and CEE embassy Twitter accounts primarily engaged in message strategies aimed at information sharing (versus facilitative, persuasive, cooperative, etc.). Overall, analyses indicated that embassy Twitter accounts primarily engaged in approaches that may lack strategy, despite their purpose being diplomatic communication. This research provides a basis for predictive, best practices research and recommendations that merge disciplines.","message strategies public diplomacy empirical using centraleastern european western embassy twitter accounts embassy twitter accounts representing centraleastern european western countries western embassies likely twitter accounts demonstrated average followers cee account polish embassy united states highest influencer score content tweets brought together relevant public diplomacy scholarship association diplomatic message strategies thus identifying relationship disciplines frequently considered separately regard public diplomacy strategies western embassies engaged primarily advocacy whereas cee embassies engaged primarily cultural diplomacy listening least likely taken western cee embassy accounts regard strategies western cee embassy twitter accounts primarily engaged message strategies aimed information sharing versus facilitative persuasive cooperative etc overall analyses indicated embassy twitter accounts primarily engaged lack strategy despite purpose diplomatic communication basis predictive best practices recommendations merge disciplines"

During crises, the stakeholder relationships are under pressure, and therewith the organization’s reputation and the crisis intensity. This paper’s purpose is to investigate how, during a crisis, pressure from both internal stakeholders (i.e., management and employees) and external stakeholders (i.e., news media and interested citizens) influences public-relations professionals’ communicative relationships with these stakeholders. 444 PR European professionals, who experienced crises, were surveyed about crisis and routine times. Special focus was on the mediation role of time pressure and uncertainty. Structural-equation models revealed that, in crisis, the increased pressure from news media, citizens, and employees negatively affects the communicative relationship with these stakeholders, whereas management pressure was found to have a positive effect. This observation might point to organizational isolation on a managerial level in the initial crisis phase, partly as a result of stakeholder pressure.","communication times crisis stakeholder relationship pressure stakeholder relationships change organization undergoes crisis compared routine circumstances crises stakeholder relationships pressure therewith organizations reputation crisis intensity s purpose investigate crisis pressure internal stakeholders e management employees external stakeholders e news media interested citizens influences publicrelations professionals communicative relationships stakeholders pr european professionals experienced crises surveyed crisis routine times special focus mediation role time pressure uncertainty structuralequation models crisis increased pressure news media citizens employees negatively affects communicative relationship stakeholders whereas management pressure positive effect observation might point organizational isolation managerial level initial crisis phase partly result stakeholder pressure"

Facebook uses an algorithm that gives different weight to each behavior to determine what to show in user’s screen, suggesting that the strategic implication of each behavior may differ from the other. This study investigates when each behavior can be encouraged by organizational messages, thereby making clearer distinctions between three behaviors. A content analysis of organizational messages was conducted, where the researchers assessed message features and related them to each behavior separately. The findings indicated that different message features generated different behaviors: Sensory and visual features led to like, rational and interactive to comment, and sensory, visual, and rational to share. This suggests that like is an affectively driven, comment is a cognitively triggered behavior, and share is either affective or cognitive or a combination of both.","like comment share facebook behavior differs people engage communication facebook via behaviorslike comment share facebook uses algorithm gives weight behavior determine users screen suggesting strategic implication behavior differ investigates behavior encouraged organizational messages thereby making clearer distinctions behaviors content organizational messages conducted researchers assessed message features behavior separately indicated message features generated behaviors sensory visual features led like rational interactive comment sensory visual rational share like affectively driven comment cognitively triggered behavior share either affective cognitive combination"

First, we conducted two waves of quantitative content analysis of health items published in 2013 and 2015 in a representative sample of magazines to get an overview of the sourcing practices of Belgian magazine journalists as visible in the news output. Second, we included 16 in-depth interviews with leading magazine health journalists and their editors-in-chief to confront the findings of the content analyses and search for additional evidence of how the pharmaceutical industry directly and indirectly tries to influence health news. The findings confirm that academic and medical experts are the most important sources. They help to explain and contextualize often complex and technical health issues, and they credit authority and credibility to a journalist’s story. In contrast, we found very little explicit references to pharmaceutical industry sources in journalistic content. Nevertheless, the findings of the interviews suggest that pharmaceutical PR creeps into health coverage in a more indirect and much more sophisticated manner, for instance by offering additional services such as contacts with scientists or patients. In addition, editors-in-chief admit they try to anticipate the needs and preferences of advertisers in aligning editorial and commercial content. We conclude that the influence of pharmaceutical PR in magazine health news is stronger than would be expected based solely on quantitative analyses of editorial content.","dirty dancing health journalists pharmaceutical industry multimethod impact pharma pr magazine health news applying multimethod purpose analyze complex ways belgian magazines deal health information supplied pr practitioners pharmaceutical industry conducted waves quantitative content health items published representative sample magazines get overview sourcing practices belgian magazine journalists visible news output second included depth interviews leading magazine health journalists editorschief confront content analyses search additional evidence pharmaceutical industry directly indirectly tries influence health news confirm academic medical experts important sources help explain contextualize complex technical health issues credit authority credibility journalists story contrast little explicit references pharmaceutical industry sources journalistic content nevertheless interviews pharmaceutical pr creeps health coverage indirect much sophisticated manner instance offering additional services contacts scientists patients addition editorschief admit try anticipate needs preferences advertisers aligning editorial commercial content conclude influence pharmaceutical pr magazine health news stronger expected solely quantitative analyses editorial content"

For China, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3, 11 and 12 offer it an opportunity to tackle its environmental sustainability challenge, an outcome of a confluence of several behavioral and organizational factors. This article proposes an environmental sustainability campaign in response to haze events—specifically as a guide to China’s meeting its public commitment to environmental health. That campaign, which can serve as a road map to other countries’ sustainability campaigns, is based on the intersection of air pollution, public health and government action in China; on the involvement of public-interest groups in energizing the grass roots toward playing a major role in environmental health; on the application of the personal influence model to campaign planning and implementation; and on the notion that citizen and public-interest groups, nongovernmental organizations, business organizations, and government agencies can be both partners and co-leaders in a coordinated, strategic communication response to an environmental sustainability crisis.","grounding civic engagement strategic communication chinas publichealth programs airquality campaigns case member states united nations committed formulating development agendas aftermath adopting goals targets sustainable development summit held september new york city china sustainable development goals sdgs opportunity tackle environmental sustainability challenge outcome confluence several behavioral organizational factors proposes environmental sustainability campaign response haze events guide chinas meeting public commitment environmental health campaign serve road map countries sustainability campaigns intersection air pollution public health government action china involvement publicinterest groups energizing grass roots playing major role environmental health application personal influence campaign planning implementation notion citizen publicinterest groups nongovernmental organizations business organizations government agencies partners coleaders coordinated strategic communication response environmental sustainability crisis"

Given the misinformation, rumors, and even conspiracy theories surrounding Zika virus, monitoring public awareness and understanding of the mysterious illness on social media could offer critical insight to crisis management. A survey (n = 226) was conducted with public information officers (PIOs) at local public health departments across the United States to reveal how they utilize and listen to social media during public health crises.

Taking the approach of strategic health risk communication, this study examined Ebola-related social media posts by three major health organizations, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, also known as Doctors without Borders), on Twitter and Instagram, focusing on the types of communication that were used during the outbreak, the content and context of these communications, and the responses they elicited from the publics. While both platforms were utilized by all three health organizations, the results suggest that Instagram may be a particularly useful platform for establishing meaningful, interactive communication with the publics in times of global health crises, as evidenced by significantly greater levels of engagement on the part of health organizations and the publics. Furthermore, our findings indicate that social media messaging may be most effective when it is used by health organizations that are familiar with and to the publics, and when it is based on the strategic use of risk communication principles such as solution-based messaging, incorporation of visual imagery, and acknowledgement of public fears and concerns. We discuss the results in the context of strategic health risk communication guidelines and implications for public relations practice.",""

WEAs are 90-character warnings issued by governments and sent by wireless carriers to individuals (for free) facing an imminent threat such as a tornado or flood. The U.S. government is considering adding maps to future WEAs. Maps are one of the most relied-on tools for people to quickly gain knowledge about spatial tasks such as evacuating during disasters.

This study fills a gap in the literature by exploring how a non-governmental organization called the American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA) worked with the U.S. federal government during World War I to equate sexual health with wartime patriotism to lower venereal disease (VD) rates. Partnering with ASHA on an anti-venereal campaign provided the government with a way to enhance military efficiency (i.e., fewer soldiers out of action with VD meant more men available to fight). In return, ASHA gained a national audience and the backing of the government for its vision of sexual health and social morality. This study shows that The Committee on Public Information (CPI) was not alone in using PR-type techniques as a weapon of mass instruction during the Great War. Similar to the CPI, the social hygiene campaign organizers used a diverse range of communications activities ranging from pamphlets to lectures to films – all for the purpose of instilling a new social health agenda.","great war venereal disease government used pr wage antivice campaign much pr historiography focuses great man corporate uses function fills gap nongovernmental organization called american social hygiene association asha worked us federal government world war equate sexual health wartime patriotism lower venereal disease vd rates partnering asha antivenereal campaign provided government way enhance military efficiency e fewer soldiers action vd meant men available fight return asha gained national audience backing government vision sexual health social morality shows committee public information cpi alone using pr techniques weapon mass instruction great war similar cpi social hygiene campaign organizers used diverse range communications activities ranging pamphlets lectures films purpose instilling new social health agenda"

Our analysis found that corrective action is the most successful and third most common strategy, particularly when paired with another strategy, such as reducing the offensiveness or bolstering. Denial, in contrast, is the least successful strategy, particularly when paired with evasion of responsibility, or reducing the offensiveness. Yet denial was the most frequently used strategy. Our analysis also uncovered mitigating factors that help shape success or failure, including one’s guilt or innocence, remaining silent, potential legal action, the scope of the crisis, and promptness in responding. Theoretical implications include a broader understanding of strategies people choose as well as intersecting contexts and factors that determine success or failure. Practical implications center on helping practitioners better utilize image repair strategies.","qualitative meta apologia image repair crisis communication practice qualitative meta thirty years apologia image repair crisis communication analyzed peerreviewed journals determine themes patterns strategies used organizations individuals facing crises threatened reputations corrective action successful third common strategy particularly paired another strategy reducing offensiveness bolstering denial contrast least successful strategy particularly paired evasion responsibility reducing offensiveness yet denial frequently used strategy uncovered mitigating factors help shape success failure s guilt innocence remaining silent potential legal action scope crisis promptness responding include broader strategies people choose intersecting contexts factors determine success failure practical center helping practitioners better utilize image repair strategies"

In a study conducted in 2016, we examined some elements of the relationship between public relations practitioners and journalists in Croatia. In this study we extend our previous research into another country – Serbia, and compare the results. Comparing the attitudes of Croatian and Serbian practitioners is essential for the expansion of public relations in those two countries, as well as for the development of global principles. The main goal of this study was to explore the relationship between the Serbian journalists and public relations practitioners. We used the coorientational model to analyze the perceptions and cross-perceptions of journalists and public relations practitioners on their role in organizational reputation building. Our results showed that the difference between the Croatian and Serbian practitioners is not in the general direction, but in the intensity of the connection. This means that the trends which exist among the Croatian public relations practitioners and journalists also exist among their Serbian colleagues, but that the level of understanding is different. In this study, both the journalists and public relations practitioners believe they have a significant influence on the organizational reputation. Both groups showed a certain level of pluralistic ignorance of the other side. The results of this study have pinpointed some interesting similarities as well as significant differences between the two groups of practitioners. Even though the trends in Croatia and Serbia are similar and show an increasing understanding between public relations practitioners and journalists, Serbia has quite an unhappy group of journalists and a very confident group of public relations practitioners. We have confirmed the findings suggesting that the situation has improved and that the animosity has been on the decline, but Serbia still has a long way to go. Just as we concluded in our previous study the only way forward in further improving this relationship is by educating the journalists about the specifics of the public relations practice and by raising the level of how each of the fields perceives the value of their own efforts.","journalists practitioners comparing countries existence nature conflict journalists practitioners sparked lot interest academic fields conducted elements relationship practitioners journalists croatia extend previous another country serbia compare comparing attitudes croatian serbian practitioners essential expansion countries development global principles main goal relationship serbian journalists practitioners used coorientational analyze perceptions crossperceptions journalists practitioners role organizational reputation building difference croatian serbian practitioners general direction intensity connection means trends exist croatian practitioners journalists exist serbian colleagues level journalists practitioners believe influence organizational reputation groups certain level pluralistic ignorance side pinpointed interesting similarities differences groups practitioners though trends croatia serbia similar increasing practitioners journalists serbia quite unhappy group journalists confident group practitioners confirmed suggesting situation improved animosity decline serbia long way go just concluded previous way forward improving relationship educating journalists specifics practice raising level fields perceives value efforts"

Following the debates on mediatization and reciprocal effects of media coverage, we assume that the amount and the tone of media coverage matter for the media orientations of communication professionals.

A quantitative content analysis was used to analyze the actual characteristics of media coverage for public and for-profit organizations as well as non-profit organizations. A survey was conducted to analyze the perceptions of coverage and mass media orientations of Dutch communication professionals working for those organizations. For public organizations, actual media favorability and perceived visibility turned out to be important predictors of the media orientation ‘attention seeking’. The organizations were rather homogeneous in their relations between actual and perceived media coverage and the media orientation ‘strategic impact’. This orientation was best predicted by volume of coverage, the substantiality of issues that were covered, and perceived visibility. Our results point at the importance of taking perceptive data into account when predicting media orientations.","make news effects actual perceived media coverage media orientations communication professionals aim assess mass media orientations communication professionals past media coverage organization way communication professionals currently evaluate importance media organizations following debates mediatization reciprocal effects media coverage assume amount tone media coverage matter media orientations communication professionals discern actual perceived characteristics media attention quantitative content used analyze actual characteristics media coverage public profit organizations nonprofit organizations survey conducted analyze perceptions coverage mass media orientations dutch communication professionals working organizations public organizations actual media favorability perceived visibility turned important predictors media orientation attention seeking organizations homogeneous relations actual perceived media coverage media orientation strategic impact orientation best predicted volume coverage substantiality issues covered perceived visibility point importance taking perceptive data account predicting media orientations"

This article aims to close this gap. Following the so-called philosophy of prestige (Carnevali, 2012), the article applies Hobbes’ doctrine of natural law and human passions to public relations historiography. Indeed, considering recognition and reputation to be critical elements for human beings in a conflictual society in which gaining power was the main goal, Hobbes anticipated critical public relations thinking. In the Hobbesian system, because recognition is a social capital, reputation management becomes the most appropriate relational strategy to negotiate and gain power. Accordingly, uncertainty characterizes reputation and dealing with it fits into risk management. Although Hobbes never used the concepts of public relations or reputational risk, he was the first thinker to approach social relations from a conflictual perspective and view reputation as a risk deriving from it. Thus, through his approach, Hobbes opened up a new perspective, differing from those of other renowned Renaissance thinkers like Machiavelli or even some of his contemporaries, like Gracián, who also dealt with the idea of reputation.",""

This study extends situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) by applying it to paracrisis situations as well as by testing a cognitive model in which breach of expectation by different actors leads to different degrees of judgment of responsibility and counterfactual thinking processes (i.e., the person could/would/should have done something else). A deny crisis response (e.g., scapegoating) was effective in reducing blame and negative affective responses and yielded less negative reputation assessment of the message source. The expectation breach led participants to engage in a counterfactual thinking process, which in turn evoked greater indignation and more negative reputation assessment. Indignation and negative reputation were both significant predictors of online word-of-mouth intention. Social vigilantism, individuals’ tendency to propagate their opinions onto others, mediated the relationship between indignation and online discussion intention.",""

In particular, it illustrates how public resistance can prevent the success of direct foreign investments despite favorable agreements with host governments; also, it shows that corporate public diplomacy can be used to develop sustainable win–win solutions supported by the general public. While existing research suggests that an important function of public relations is to create a perception of legitimacy and that the hope of economic and commercial public diplomacy is to create a perception of attractiveness among the public in foreign countries, this paper suggests that the concept of corporate public diplomacy – that is, collaboration with the general public in a host country through negotiations directly with civic society – should be considered a supplement to other forms of corporate diplomacy.","corporate public diplomacy illustrates several factors make corporate public diplomacy fundamentally activities aim legitimacy alone case suspended chinese hydropower project e myitsone dam northern myanmar presented address functional differences corporate practice particular illustrates public resistance prevent success direct foreign investments despite favorable agreements host governments shows corporate public diplomacy used develop sustainable winwin solutions supported general public existing important function create perception legitimacy hope economic commercial public diplomacy create perception attractiveness public foreign countries concept corporate public diplomacy collaboration general public host country negotiations directly civic society considered supplement forms corporate diplomacy"

Additionally, this study seeks to ascertain if the different types of college studies taken are linked to communication and, specifically, to public relations. Members of the Association of Communication Directors-Dircom were chosen as the sample, whose curricula appeared in its 2015 directory. Results indicate that the subjects of the sample were mostly academic, and that previous communication training they received was prevalent in the four training variables analyzed. Consistent with the international literature reviewed in this study, it is however noted that most subjects held degrees in Journalism (21.56%), ranking well above those who studied Public Relations (6.67%), which could be the reason that knowledge and skills acquired by Spanish professionals are still insufficient for the proper practice of the position, thus perpetuating the press-agent model, without allowing an evolution to more mature levels of praxis, with more managerial and strategic orientations. The quality of previous university training received by Spanish practitioners is particularly relevant at the moment, since higher education within the EHEA, conceived as a satisfier of labor-market needs, has not yet materialized, and because the Dircom association has recently joined the project of international professional accreditation promoted by the GA-Global Alliance.","university curricula spanish dircoms aims determine university qualifications prevalent spanish communications professionals degree level certificate advanced diplomatura level third level phd diploma advanced dea additionally seeks ascertain college taken linked communication members association communication directorsdircom chosen sample whose curricula appeared directory subjects sample mostly academic previous communication training received prevalent training variables analyzed consistent international reviewed noted subjects held degrees journalism ranking studied reason knowledge skills acquired spanish professionals insufficient proper practice position thus perpetuating pressagent without allowing evolution mature levels praxis managerial strategic orientations quality previous university training received spanish practitioners particularly relevant moment since higher education ehea conceived satisfier labormarket needs yet materialized dircom association recently joined project international professional accreditation promoted gaglobal alliance"

Political success is often credited cleverly crafted communication strategies. The Norwegian Labour Party applied methods similar to those found in Nazi Germany as of 1933/34, luring voters away from the dogmatic Right and Left, to the leftist social democratic movement. One key element of this highly successful strategy is the shift from a somber accentuation on methods of scientific persuasion, emphasizing a perceived rationale of a social system based in Marxism, to propaganda, bombarding masses with slogans and one-liners. Another key element is an acknowledgement of indifferent voters. The vast majority of the voter potential did not attend political meeting and were unable to recognize and separate ideologies. This led party strategists to developing methodologieson how to approach voters as crowds, not merely as individual citizens in large numbers. Recognizing the homogeneity and protective environment of the Darwinian herd, crowds became target groups for the Labour Party election campaigns, in which they found gratification by unison songs, theatrical entertainment and simple slogans.","targeting crowds norwegian labour party adapted nazi rhetorical methodology immense success post wwi europeantotalitarian regimes form backdrop political success credited cleverly crafted communication strategies norwegian labour party applied methods similar nazi germany luring voters away dogmatic right left leftist social democratic movement element highly successful strategy shift somber accentuation methods scientific persuasion emphasizing perceived rationale social system marxism propaganda bombarding masses slogans liners another element acknowledgement indifferent voters vast majority voter potential attend political meeting unable recognize separate ideologies led party strategists developing methodologieson voters crowds merely individual citizens large numbers recognizing homogeneity protective environment darwinian herd crowds became target groups labour party election campaigns gratification unison songs theatrical entertainment simple slogans"

This article reports the results of an experiment designed to (i) test the effects of these two strategies on individuals’ trust in a company accused of corruption, and (ii) determine whether and how evidence of the company’s guilt influences stakeholder reactions to its trust repair message. The results demonstrate that, when evidence against the company is weak, trust is restored more successfully with a denial than an apology. Contrary to our hypothesis, denial was found to outperform apology in repairing perceptions of the company’s integrity and benevolence even in the face of strong evidence, and it was as effective as apology in restoring perceived ability and trusting intentions. These results provide empirical evidence for the ‘paradoxical effect’ that an open and honest attitude can, in the short term, be more detrimental to organizations than a defensive strategy. More research on the factors that determine the credibility and persuasiveness of corporate denial is called for.","denial outperforms apology repairing organizational trust despite strong evidence guilt previous work areas organizational trust repair crisis communication provided conflicting answers question denial effective apology repairing stakeholder trust company following integrity violation reports experiment designed test effects strategies individuals trust company accused corruption ii determine evidence companys guilt influences stakeholder reactions trust repair message demonstrate evidence company weak trust restored successfully denial apology contrary hypothesis denial outperform apology repairing perceptions companys integrity benevolence face strong evidence effective apology restoring perceived ability trusting intentions empirical evidence paradoxical effect open honest attitude short term detrimental organizations defensive strategy factors determine credibility persuasiveness corporate denial called"

Senior sport communications professionals in Northern Ireland provided their perspectives on issues and crisis management via in-depth interviews. Findings revealed that practitioners pay considerable attention to the ‘tipping point’, the point where a crisis emerged from an existing issue marking the initiation of a crisis response. Declaring a crisis was deemed a last resort in the management of issues due to declarations being associated with resource and reputational risks. Practitioners developed their own methods for managing the crisis response, however reflection upon academic approaches informed these views.

However, organizations and individuals in crisis often respond in an audiovisual manner (e.g., press conferences, corporate videos). Audiovisual messages convey not only verbal but also nonverbal cues (e.g., gaze aversion, speech errors). These nonverbal cues can affect the public’s perception of deception, and thus, the perception of the speaker’s credibility. Through a content analysis of 160 audiovisual crisis responses, this study examines which nonverbal cues of deception are communicated by organizations and individuals in crisis and how situational factors (e.g., crisis type) affect the occurrence of these nonverbal cues. The findings show that several nonverbal cues of deception occur in audiovisual crisis communication and that their occurrence depends on the crisis type, the source, and the crisis communication format.","nonverbal cues deception audiovisual crisis communication crisis communication mainly focused verbal response strategies apologies denial organizations individuals crisis respond audiovisual manner eg press conferences corporate videos audiovisual messages convey verbal nonverbal cues eg gaze aversion speech errors nonverbal cues affect publics perception deception thus perception speakers credibility content audiovisual crisis responses nonverbal cues deception communicated organizations individuals crisis situational factors eg crisis affect occurrence nonverbal cues several nonverbal cues deception occur audiovisual crisis communication occurrence depends crisis source crisis communication format"

Through content-analyzing organizational responses to three well-known crises, the study observes that the public relations strategy is used more often than the legal strategy. It also finds that when the examined organizations respond to their crises, they tend not to emphasize ethical approaches, though when they do it is more often the ethics of justice approach than that of the ethics of care. Therefore, this study urges organizations to reflect on whether their crisis communication and management decisions lack sufficient emphasis on ethical approaches, especially on the interpersonal and situational aspects of involved publics in crises. If such deficiency exits, it would be problematic because these interpersonal and situational aspects, when addressed strategically, can help an organization to rebuild post-crisis reputation and maintain positive relationships with its publics in the long run.","application researched typologies crisis communication ethics justice vs care vs legal strategies investigates organizations crisis responses adopting extant researched typologies vs legal strategies ethics justice vs care contentanalyzing organizational responses known crises observes strategy used legal strategy finds organizations respond crises tend emphasize ethical though ethics justice ethics care therefore urges organizations reflect crisis communication management decisions lack sufficient emphasis ethical especially interpersonal situational aspects involved publics crises deficiency exits problematic interpersonal situational aspects addressed strategically help organization rebuild postcrisis reputation maintain positive relationships publics long run"

Numerous studies have demonstrated that an adequate use of digital media is essential to understanding and responding to the expectations of different audiences and to be able to improve the effectiveness of communication departments (Kent & Saffer, 2014; Linke & Zerfass, 2013; Moreno et al., 2015). Nonetheless, there are still relevant issues that have yet to be addressed in depth, such as the process of converting online audiences into active communicators, or what their expectations are with respect to digital interactions. This article compares the perspectives of public relations professionals against those of the general public in Spain with respect to the content that organizations should offer and what activities they should carry out in the context of social media.

"917",2017,"academic_review","academic","Marketplace commodification of risk communication: Consequences for risk bearers and implications for public relations Society’s attempt to understand and communicate about risk is perhaps the world’s oldest topic − the rationale for human existence and survival (Douglas, 1992). This paper takes critical stock of public relations scholarship and practices in the daunting complex that has become known as the infrastructural approach to risk communication. This approach blends critical judgment of the community structures where risk is discussed and the discourse in which it is analyzed as the foundation for risk governance needed for fully functioning societies. The critical lens of hegemony and postmodernism reveals how an increasing amount of risk communication scholarship and practice has evolved into a new professional, industrial, and societal hegemony that often marginalizes risk bearers and risk arbiters as a nuisance in an otherwise modern and elitist approach to risk control through which risk communication becomes a “priced commodity.” Such commodification can empower organizations to take further risks because of the perceived confidence that its robust risk management programs and risk communication teams, including public relations, can control the dialogue and thereby help protect it from business continuity failure. The great challenge is whether risk communication and management ultimately favors the interests of elites over, and even to the marginalization and subjugation of, the interests of risk bearers and arbiters, ignoring the experiences of inequalities over the life span.",""

While it is premature to confirm the change, previous research has found that PR practitioners remain trialing with social media for purposes related to organizational communication. By conducting in-depth interviews with 19 practitioners from corporate, governmental and non-profit organizations in Kuwait, this qualitative study aims to understand how Kuwaiti organizations use social media to achieve PR objectives, the advantages and barriers PR practitioners face when using them as well as the extent whether or not social media have changed PR. Kuwaiti organizations were found to use Twitter and Instagram the most for promotion and information dissemination, but the use is generally occasional and reactive. Extending the organizations’ reach and popularity of social media among Kuwaitis were the main advantages for using this type of media, while lack of social media strategy, lack of technical skills, and confusion of the two-way communication approach were the main barriers. A new finding can be added to the literature where insufficient educational background was found to contribute to the practitioners’ reluctance to adopt and adapt to using social media. As to any causing change to PR, the respondents believe that social media have broadened the field and have made organizations look less official and more mainstream in the popular culture. The implications of the findings suggest the need for a strategic approach in terms of purpose, roles, responsibilities, policies and guidelines toward the management of social media between higher management and PR practitioners.

Employee engagement is recognised as important for organisational effectiveness and a factor in achieving innovation and competiveness. Despite the importance of engagement, relatively little research has yet been done on communication and engagement. This paper aims to contribute to knowledge in this area by providing insight on internal communication and organisational level employee engagement. The paper reports the results of a study exploring associations between aspects of internal communication and organisational engagement. Taking an employee-centric approach, the paper investigates employee satisfaction with opportunities to exercise their voice, and assesses employee views on the quality of senior management receptiveness to employee voice. The paper aims to address gaps in the literature by exploring potential associations between employee voice and organisational engagement. A questionnaire was used to gather data from 2066 participants in five UK-based organisations. The questionnaire used in the study was designed to explore satisfaction with upward employee voice and senior management receptiveness. It also enables exploration of the relationship between upward employee voice, senior manager receptiveness and emotional organisational engagement. A significant and positive relationship was found between upward employee voice and emotional organisational engagement; and between senior manager receptiveness and emotional organisational engagement. Regression analysis suggests that the majority of the employee voice variables included in the study predict emotional organisational engagement. While the study involved data collected from a reasonably large number of participants, it was limited to five UK-based organisations. The paper includes reflection on practical implications of the findings for internal communication management. In particular, it considers implications for senior management communication with employees including building employee voice into internal corporate communication strategies and plans. Suggestions for further research are included. The paper contributes to employee engagement literature by expanding insight on organisational engagement. Since relatively little previous research has considered the interplay between internal communication, organisational engagement and employee voice, the study makes a useful contribution to an under-researched area.","employee voice antecedent organisational engagement employee engagement recognised important organisational effectiveness factor achieving innovation competiveness despite importance engagement relatively little yet done communication engagement aims contribute knowledge area providing insight internal communication organisational level employee engagement reports associations aspects internal communication organisational engagement taking employeecentric investigates employee satisfaction opportunities exercise voice assesses employee views quality senior management receptiveness employee voice aims address gaps potential associations employee voice organisational engagement questionnaire used gather data participants uk organisations questionnaire used designed satisfaction upward employee voice senior management receptiveness enables exploration relationship upward employee voice senior manager receptiveness emotional organisational engagement positive relationship upward employee voice emotional organisational engagement senior manager receptiveness emotional organisational engagement regression majority employee voice variables included predict emotional organisational engagement involved data collected reasonably large number participants limited uk organisations includes reflection practical internal communication management particular considers senior management communication employees building employee voice internal corporate communication strategies plans suggestions included contributes employee engagement expanding insight organisational engagement since relatively little previous considered interplay internal communication organisational engagement employee voice makes useful contribution researched area"

Despite lack of clarity on the concept of engagement, research has been thriving, propelled by the increasing prevalence of social media and organizations’ consequent rush to digitally engage publics. This paper assesses the use of engagement in the field of public relations and critiques the equation of engagement with communicative interaction, with its foregrounding engagement as collaboration over that of engagement as control. It also builds upon theoretical conceptualizations of public/stakeholder engagement, employee engagement, and digital engagement to propose a practice-relevant and theoretically informed model and definition of engagement: Engagement is an affective, cognitive, and behavioral state wherein publics and organizations who share mutual interests in salient topics interact along continua that range from passive to active and from control to collaboration, and is aimed at goal attainment, adjustment, and adaptation for both publics and organizations.","putting engagement proper place state field definition engagement engagement catchword practice decade term applied loosely imply form communicative interaction publics organizations despite lack clarity concept engagement thriving propelled increasing prevalence social media organizations consequent rush digitally engage publics assesses use engagement field critiques equation engagement communicative interaction foregrounding engagement collaboration engagement control builds upon conceptualizations publicstakeholder engagement employee engagement digital engagement propose practicerelevant theoretically informed definition engagement engagement affective cognitive behavioral state wherein publics organizations share mutual interests salient topics interact along continua range passive active control collaboration aimed goal attainment adjustment adaptation publics organizations"

While the practice is embracing new trends, the questions of understanding, explaining and managing engagement of different publics appear to be largely unexplored in public relations discipline. The purpose of this study is to examine the state of public engagement studies in public relations scholarship in terms of themes, contexts, theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches. The study conducted content analysis of 59 journal articles on public engagement published in the last decade in Journal of Communication Management, Journal of Public Relations Research, Public Relations Inquiry and Public Relations Review. The results indicate that scarce studies on public engagement tend to be mostly concerned with social media and online engagement, studied from management/functional and relational perspectives, focussed on organizations, anchored in western traditions and dominated by quantitative methodology. This indicates that public engagement tends to be conceptualized as a phenomenon that organizations need to “manage” to advance their interests rather than to understand in terms of dynamics, connectedness, participation, dialogue, and interactions with publics. It is strongly influenced by post-positivism with some encouraging evidence of paradigmatic turn towards socio-cultural and critical approaches.","engagement discipline themes perspectives methodological several practitioners experts field emphasized importance public engagement context new technological social developments impact reshaping reconceptualising practice embracing new trends questions explaining managing engagement publics appear largely unexplored discipline purpose state public engagement scholarship terms themes contexts perspectives methodological conducted content journal public engagement published last decade journal communication management journal inquiry review scarce public engagement tend mostly concerned social media online engagement studied managementfunctional relational perspectives focussed organizations anchored western traditions dominated quantitative methodology indicates public engagement tends conceptualized phenomenon organizations need manage advance interests terms dynamics connectedness participation dialogue interactions publics strongly influenced postpositivism encouraging evidence paradigmatic turn towards sociocultural critical"

Utilizing an online survey data of 272 Chinese users of WeChat, the most influential mobile social networking application in China, this study examined the relationships between perceived values of branded WeChat accounts, consumer engagement on the account, quality of business-consumer relationships, and purchase intention. Results showed that consumer engagement is driven by five perceived values. Consumer engagement affected relationship quality and overall purchase intention.

Over the past few decades, the boundaries between the three sectors have blurred, and new types of organizations and initiatives that combine environmental aims with business approaches have emerged. These new organizations and initiatives create a challenge for public relations practitioners: practitioners need to raise awareness among various publics to a new type of organization that combines both societal and business-like characteristics, and they need to promote dialogue and engagement with these publics. This study focuses on social businesses—that is, self-sustainable businesses that address social goals (Yunus, 2007). Based on a representative sample of 202 respondents, this study utilizes the Diffusion of Innovations theory (DOI) (Rogers, 1962) to argue for the importance of engagement to a successful process of diffusion and to demonstrate how DOI theory might enrich public relations theory and practice.","social businesses importance enhancing engagement usually practiced clearly defined organizational settings public governmental sector private business sector social nonprofit sector past decades boundaries sectors blurred new organizations initiatives combine environmental aims business emerged new organizations initiatives create challenge practitioners practitioners need raise awareness publics new organization combines societal businesslike characteristics need promote dialogue engagement publics focuses social businesses selfsustainable businesses address social goals yunus representative sample respondents utilizes diffusion innovations doi rogers argue importance engagement successful process diffusion demonstrate doi might enrich practice"

Debate about the average length of a human attention span can obscure the salient features of these developments and consideration of how public relations could respond to them. While not offering solutions, this paper suggests that several areas warrant review, including the place of visual communication; engaging with the implications of increasing use of mobile devices and with the fast-developing field of The Internet of Things.

This element is even more pronounced during times of global crisis in the communications industry where the number of jobs is decreasing, and the increase in criticism of educational institutions, which can be summarized in the claim that educational programs are not adapted to market needs. Guided by this situation, in this paper, the authors analyze the interrelationship between the academic community and employers in the communications industry, and compare their views on the issue of knowledge, skills and competencies which communication professionals must possess in order to be successful in this profession.

The role of common group affiliation in crisis communication This research analyzes the effectiveness of a CEO spokesperson’s affiliation to a social group during a crisis. Specifically, it addresses the question of whether a group affiliation with a large heterogeneous group, such as parents, can engender similarly positive effects in members of the same social category, compared with a smaller distinctive group, here an amateur sports community. An experimental study using a product harm crisis by a bicycle manufacturer as stimulus was conducted to answer the research question. The results reveal positive effects when the CEO signaled his/her affiliation with a social group that is distinctive and rather homogenous. In this case, corporate trustworthiness, purchase intentions, and abstaining from negative word-of-mouth are directly impacted by stakeholders’ identification with the CEO spokesperson, and indirectly through identification with the CEO and message credibility. However, when the CEO spokesperson communicated his/her affiliation with a large and heterogeneous group, in this case parents, the company did not benefit.

By providing official updates, the company consistently attempted to keep the public informed in order to avoid information gaps. Furthermore, TEPCO used the attribution frame more than the apology frame. More precisely, the organization evaded its accountability by assigning blame to the earthquake and apologized only when definitely necessary—such as regarding a loss of employees and discomforts caused by the crisis.

This study, based on interviews with Dutch mayors who were personally involved in crises between 1979 and 2014, assesses the various roles of public leaders’ meaning making. A total of 94 case studies were analyzed for this purpose. Responsibility and collective impact turn out to be closely intertwined phenomena, which influence the modus operandi as a public leader as perceived by the mayors themselves. The Public Meaning Making Model presented, shows four distinctive roles based on the meaning making by Dutch mayors: the roles of ‘mourner-in-chief’, ‘orchestrator’, ‘advocate’ and ‘buddy’. All of these roles emphasize different elements that depend on the collective, emotional impact of a situation as well as on the political responsibility attributed to the public leader.

Thousands of innocent people were injured or killed. In its sharp lines, its confusion and its distorted shapes, Guernica shows the suffering and pain of war. Rather than using color, especially vivid reds, Picasso used only black and white paint as symbols of death, mourning and tragedy. He believed that brighter colors might distract the viewer from the agony of the scene. In Guernica, most of the figures have open mouths; hear them shouting, groaning or screaming. The aim of this paper and its relevance to public relations is to examine whether and how visual communication can publicize and frame a military event, the character of military leaders, and warfare as a generic aspect of democratic self-governance. This paper proposes that rhetorical, discursive art can contribute impact to public relations efforts, by focusing attention, making issues public, and making informative, framing, and democratizing statements. Even more important is the ability of art to express moral outrage, especially when giving voice to muted interests.","publicizing atrocity legitimizing outrage picassos guernica picasso created famous painting guernica just weeks bombing little town guernica located basque region spanish civil war thousands innocent people injured killed sharp lines confusion distorted shapes guernica shows suffering pain war using color especially vivid reds picasso used black white paint symbols death mourning tragedy believed brighter colors might distract viewer agony scene guernica figures open mouths hear shouting groaning screaming aim relevance visual communication publicize frame military event character military leaders warfare generic aspect democratic selfgovernance proposes rhetorical discursive art contribute impact efforts focusing attention making issues public making informative framing democratizing statements important ability art express moral outrage especially giving voice muted interests"

Social media has changed the situation since the public have now become senders and engage in secondary crisis communication (SCC) that affects corporate crisis management. However, our understanding of the mechanism of SCC on social media is still limited. This study aims to reveal how the public engages in the decision-making process related to SCC from a social control perspective by critically considering the broadcasting and social network functions of social media. Our research hypotheses were supported by a survey conducted after a real crisis in China. The results indicate that cognitive reputation results in SCC by causing the public to feel morally violated, and that such feelings of violation lead to individuals being more likely to engage in SCC given the perception of support for their opinions on social media. Thus, this research provides a better understanding of SCC from the public’s perspective in the context of social media.","relationship corporate reputation publics crisis communication social media traditional crisis communication public treated passive receivers firmdominated crisis communication social media changed situation since public now become senders engage secondary crisis communication scc affects corporate crisis management mechanism scc social media limited aims reveal public engages decisionmaking process scc social control perspective critically considering broadcasting social network functions social media hypotheses supported survey conducted real crisis china cognitive reputation scc causing public feel morally violated feelings violation lead individuals likely engage scc given perception support opinions social media thus better scc publics perspective context social media"

By detecting or perceiving a crisis before other stakeholders do, an organisation can prevent or mitigate a crisis. Few studies have considered the question of whether organisations put the right people in the right places to be able to see a crisis coming. Within an organisation, managers are usually well placed to take decisions to initiate crisis communication, but they seem to be reluctant to do so or may not wish to see an impending crisis. Communication professionals should have a better perception of a crisis, but they rarely find themselves in a position to have a substantial impact on the management decision to communicate during a crisis. In this paper, we study crisis perception by individuals in a large governmental organisation during various stages of an unfolding crisis and compared perception scores to individual profiles based on study background, professional situation and crisis experience.

Situated in this major gap, the current investigation adopts a community-centered approach that combines insights from chaos theory, uncertainty reduction theory, and sensemaking theory. This study used a mixed method design to examine the role of a campus community in dealing with a variety of campus crises. The qualitative study gave an in-depth understanding of how a crisis is perceived and the underlying process of how a community helps to make sense of a crisis. The quantitative study tested and further illustrated this process through path analysis. The major contributions of this study to the current crisis communication literature are twofold: (1) a crisis-induced community building model that demonstrates a community’s role in helping community members self-organize, collectively make sense of a crisis, and reproduce community experiences; and (2) instruments to measure a crisis and community functionalities.

Emerging evidence indicates that the emotional experiences of publics play a critical role during organizational crises and determine the degree to which organizations are able to successfully devise communications that help them deal with such crises. Yet no comprehensive, theoretically sound model exists for analyzing how emotions influence the cognitive processing of crisis information. Our study proposes just such a model, capable of describing how cognition and emotion, separately or interactively, influence the publics’ processing of crisis information and consequently their attitudes and behaviors. Our model describes how emotional variables determine whether the publics take a cognition-oriented approach or an emotion-oriented approach to information processing and subsequent formation of interpretations, evaluations, and judgments directed toward organizations. Moreover, our model explains how an emotion-to-cognition assessment of publics’ attitudes is possible and makes a case for how it is critical for predicting and influencing the publics’ behavior during organizational crises. The hope is that this model will aid practitioners and academics in understanding why the publics’ emotions matter during crisis communication as well as how to craft more effective communication strategies as a result. Finally, several avenues for future research are suggested in order to test the validity of our conceptual model in different contexts.","getting emotional emotioncognition dualfactor crisis communication effect emotional experience cognitive processes explored phenomenon crisis communication despite indications increasing importance emotion communication digital era emerging evidence indicates emotional experiences publics play critical role organizational crises determine degree organizations able successfully devise communications help deal crises yet comprehensive theoretically sound exists analyzing emotions influence cognitive processing crisis information proposes just capable describing cognition emotion separately interactively influence publics processing crisis information consequently attitudes behaviors describes emotional variables determine publics take cognitionoriented emotionoriented information processing subsequent formation interpretations evaluations judgments directed organizations moreover explains emotioncognition assessment publics attitudes possible makes case critical predicting influencing publics behavior organizational crises hope aid practitioners academics publics emotions matter crisis communication craft effective communication strategies result finally several avenues future suggested order test validity conceptual contexts"

A crisis is assumed to only bring negative impacts because it tarnishes an organization’s reputation. Priority is placed upon whether an organization can come up with response strategies that mitigate this harm, rather than on rebuilding relationships. Challenging these untested assumptions, discourse of renewal is complementary to the image- and reputation-centered perspectives and theorizes crises as opportunities to reflect, grow, and therefore renew to a better state. To further discourse of renewal, the current study first establishes a valid and reliable measure of discourse of renewal, and investigates how discourse of renewal influences publics’ relationship with an organization. Results of the study indicate that engagement, prospective foci, communication efficiency, and emphasis on organizational culture and core values are four dimensions of discourse of renewal, and that discourse of renewal positively influences publics’ relationship with an organization.","discourse renewal developing multipleitem measurement analyzing effects relationships emphasis protecting organizations image reputation dominated crisis communication crisis assumed bring negative impacts tarnishes organizations reputation priority placed upon organization come response strategies mitigate harm rebuilding relationships challenging untested assumptions discourse renewal complementary image reputationcentered perspectives theorizes crises opportunities reflect grow therefore renew better state discourse renewal current establishes valid reliable measure discourse renewal investigates discourse renewal influences publics relationship organization engagement prospective foci communication efficiency emphasis organizational culture core values dimensions discourse renewal discourse renewal positively influences publics relationship organization"

"968",2018,"academic_review","academic","Dialogue, strategic communication, and ethical public relations: Lessons from Martin Buber’s political activism Dialogue and persuasive strategic communication are often perceived by public relations scholars as two distinct approaches to the practice. After revisiting and reassessing debates surrounding the two approaches, this article introduces accounts of the use of dialogue and strategic communication in the political life of Martin Buber, whose philosophy has inspired PR scholarship on dialogue. It traces Buber’s writings and activities as communicator in the service of the early Zionist movement and, in his later life, as campaigner against the establishment of the State of Israel, and as promoter of dialogue between Zionists and Arab Palestinians. Based on archival research the article uncovers Buber’s political and PR work to provide insights into his philosophy in the context of his political and life experiences. Inspired by Buber’s work the article argues that dialogue and strategic communication both have the potential to be deployed ethically, and for prosocial causes, or to be deployed in a self-serving and unethical way. In this, it supports other scholars’ argument that public relations should reconcile with the fact that both are legitimate tools and it further argues that both might be used either ethically or unethically. It concludes that ethical PR practice depends less on the form of communication, and more on transparency, honesty, openness, and respect in the way dialogue or strategic communication are conducted.","dialogue strategic communication ethical lessons martin bubers political activism dialogue persuasive strategic communication perceived scholars distinct practice revisiting reassessing debates surrounding introduces accounts use dialogue strategic communication political life martin buber whose philosophy inspired pr scholarship dialogue traces bubers writings activities communicator service early zionist movement later life campaigner establishment state israel promoter dialogue zionists arab palestinians archival uncovers bubers political pr work insights philosophy context political life experiences inspired bubers work argues dialogue strategic communication potential deployed ethically prosocial causes deployed selfserving unethical way supports scholars argument reconcile fact legitimate tools argues might used either ethically unethically concludes ethical pr practice depends form communication transparency honesty openness respect way dialogue strategic communication conducted"

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how public relations can serve an organization’s internal communication by better understanding how employees perceive and experience engagement. Following a phenomenological methodology (n = 32), this study utilized zones of meaning as a conceptual foundation (not a literal interpretation) to examine the process related to the complex, shifting and shared meaning of zones of engagement and how zones of meaning are products as well as drivers of engagement, which offer a new way to conceptualize employee engagement in public relations, shifting to a deeper comprehension and understanding. The findings show that employee experiences align more to Kahn’s (1990) initial personal engagement model than other public relations models. The psychological conditions of meaningfulness and safety from the original employee engagement model emerged as important factors in defining the employees’ shared-meaning lived experiences. In addition, this study offers a new definition of disengagement, which is similar but unique to the scholarship on negative engagement. The findings provide a framework for public relations scholars who work to further refine the understanding of employee engagement and for practitioners who develop public relations strategies for internal audiences, and advances the conceptual foundation of zones of meaning in public relations scholarship.",""

Therefore, this secondary analysis examined the state of women and gender scholarship about leadership in public relations as part of a larger study about the state of women in the communication discipline. Specifically, our research found that the majority of the research about leadership and gender highlights women’s lackluster leadership presence, factors contributing to women’s lack of presence, leadership styles and preferences, and leadership and management roles of women.

Examination of this topic is important given that reflective practice is widely recognised as an essential element for claims of professionalism (Dewey, 1933; Schön, 1983, 1987), and professionalism remains an elusive goal for PR practitioners (L’Etang, 2009). This article examines the extent to which the terms and processes associated with reflective practice are formally included in the contents of a range of widely used and well regarded public relations textbooks. The aim is to provide insight into the significance (or lack of it) of reflective practice in contemporary public relations curricula. Given that textbooks are highly influential teaching media that both reflect and shape curricula, conclusions about the emphasis of reflective practice in public relations teaching can be drawn as a result of this analysis. The findings indicate that – based on the content of the textbooks analysed – reflective practice is not formally included in the public relations teaching curriculum. Further research is needed to determine whether this omission also reflects the situation in public relations practice. This research has relevance for public relations educators given that they play a significant role in influencing future generations of public relations professionals.

The purpose of the study was to understand the forms of media non-transparency that exist in the United States, levels of non-transparency at the national and local/regional media, and perceptions of non-transparent practices by the public relations practitioners in the country. The project builds on previous research on global media transparency (Tsetsura & Kruckeberg, 2011) and uses Tsetsura’s (2005) framework to study media transparency. The survey results showed that direct media bribery is not a pressing issue in the United States; however, indirect media pressures that involve new forms of content creation, including native advertising and content marketing, are worrisome. Specifically, forms of indirect media bribery are common at the local and regional media levels in the USA. Research findings demonstrate that U.S. practitioners experience particular non-transparent challenges when working with the media and recognize financial pressures that U.S. media outlets face today. The results provide a basis for creating standards in U.S. practice to ensure that new forms of content creation, including native advertising and content marketing, are not acceptable at any level when sources of content are not disclosed.

Content analysis of Donald Trump’s and Hillary Clinton’s 3-month tweets (N = 1575) revealed that half of their tweets were attacks, and those attacks were effective in attracting favorites and retweets for both candidates. Their tweets reflected their issue agendas highlighted on campaign websites, and they mainly emphasized issues owned by their parties in both venues. Some of the issues Trump stressed in his tweets (i.e., media bias and Clinton’s alleged dishonesty) drew significantly more favorites and retweets, suggesting public agenda setting possibilities through Twitter. None of the issues Clinton emphasized were significant predictors of favorites and retweets. However, visual elements such as pictures and videos were effective in bringing voter reactions for Clinton.

While TLC was not responsible for the molestation, their proximity to the family and their relationship with the Duggars led to criticism and thus, a plan to improve their image.

"985",2018,"academic_review","academic","Power struggles: A sociological approach to activist communication This paper proposes an alternative approach to the scholarship of activist public relations, based on the ideas of the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu; notably his understanding of activism in society. Although Bourdieu is one of the most quoted sociologists in the world (Santoro, 2011; Truong & Weill, 2012), his work has only received limited attention in public relations, and has been entirely ignored within the context of activist communication. This is despite his focus on power, relationships and the role of activists in modern democracies, all of which are central themes in public relations practice and research. Based on Bourdieu’s theory of practice, the discipline’s prevailing, dominant, industry serving, functionalist paradigm positions public relations’ role in society as to perpetuate social inequalities. However, drawing on his ideas leads us to question if public relations skills could be equally utilized to challenge existing power imbalances in society, either in support or on behalf of those groups and individuals whose voices have been drowned out by traditional public relations efforts. The author argues that Bourdieu was not only an accomplished scholar, but also an activist in his own right. It is this combination of personal experience with academic ideas that lends weight to his scholarly work through which he urged the scholarly community to utilize their skills, knowledge and research to challenge (perceived) inequalities in society. The emergence of this type of activist academic, committed to giving voice to multiple coexisting, sometimes directly competing points of views, would arguably further justify and strengthen the existence of public relations as a scholarly discipline in its own right.","power struggles sociological activist communication proposes alternative scholarship activist ideas sociologist pierre bourdieu notably activism society bourdieu quoted sociologists world santoro truong weill work received limited attention entirely ignored context activist communication despite focus power relationships role activists modern democracies central themes practice bourdieus practice disciplines prevailing dominant industry serving functionalist paradigm positions role society perpetuate social inequalities drawing ideas leads us question skills equally utilized challenge existing power imbalances society either support behalf groups individuals whose voices drowned traditional efforts author argues bourdieu accomplished scholar activist right combination personal experience academic ideas lends weight scholarly work urged scholarly community utilize skills knowledge challenge perceived inequalities society emergence activist academic committed giving voice multiple coexisting sometimes directly competing points views arguably justify strengthen existence scholarly discipline right"

These results suggest the use of fear appeals in health, crisis, and risk public relations campaigns may promote performance of recommended safeguarding behaviors.","hpv vaccination campaign fear visuals eyetracking effects visual attention message informative value recall behavioral intentions hpv common sexually transmitted disease alarming global disparities cervical cancer hpv vaccination uptake cdc inform hpv vaccination public health campaigns experiment psychophysiological measure eyetracking effects visual attention vaccination messages message recall informative value behavioral intentions visual affects recall informative value vaccination messages intentions vaccinate visual attention negatively message recall nonfear visual used visual attention predicts intent vaccinate fear visual utilized use fear appeals health crisis risk campaigns promote performance recommended safeguarding behaviors"

Yet there is a profound lack of scholarly research in public relations, crisis communication, and disaster communication to explore the effects of content displayed using these delivery formats on publics’ responses. To begin addressing the knowledge gap, this work reports results from a laboratory experiment investigating effects of media modality (traditional unidirectional video content vs. 360° omnidirectional video content) on attitudes toward the disaster communication content. Results demonstrate that 360° video featuring the aftermath of a natural disaster yields enhanced attitudes toward the helpful impact of the content. Importantly, mediation analyses show that (1) a sense of spatial presence underlies these effects, and (2) the mediating effects of spatial presence are attenuated by involvement with similar disaster media coverage (indirect experience).","effects video attitudes disaster communication mediating moderating roles spatial presence prior disaster media involvement visual media technologies video augmented reality virtual reality rise immersive storytelling variety contexts yet profound lack scholarly crisis communication disaster communication effects content displayed using delivery formats publics responses begin addressing knowledge gap work reports laboratory experiment investigating effects media modality traditional unidirectional video content vs omnidirectional video content attitudes disaster communication content demonstrate video featuring aftermath natural disaster yields enhanced attitudes helpful impact content importantly mediation analyses sense spatial presence underlies effects mediating effects spatial presence attenuated involvement similar disaster media coverage indirect experience"

As brands adapt and adjust their Facebook visual content strategy to capture the attention of their publics in crowded News Feeds, they also need to employ text-based engagement strategies that get users to engage and interact with brand content. Once users start interacting with brand content, it is more likely that other users will engage with the content as well, igniting a conversation.

A survey of 342 public relations practitioners revealed that providing monetary gifts, performing formal responsibility, building informal relationships, receiving paid media coverage, and giving and accepting informal support were found to be significant subdimensions of media relations. After implementation of the anti-graft law, public relations practitioners expressed a belief that the practice of providing monetary gifts would shrink the most and that performing formal responsibility would experience the most growth. The formal responsibility factor was significantly positively related to support for the new law and public relations ethics, while giving and accepting informal support was negatively linked to public relations ethics. Paid media coverage showed a positive relationship with public relations practitioners’ perceptions about difficulties of increasing outputs of media relations. Finally, this empirical study shows how new external regulations arising from implementation of the anti-graft law can affect the personal influence model of media relations in Korea.","exploratory transformed media relations dimensions implementation antigraft law korea improper solicitation graft act went effect september strictly prohibits gift giving journalists thereby making traditional media relations practice korea illegal survey practitioners providing monetary gifts performing formal responsibility building informal relationships receiving paid media coverage giving accepting informal support subdimensions media relations implementation antigraft law practitioners expressed belief practice providing monetary gifts shrink performing formal responsibility experience growth formal responsibility factor significantly positively support new law ethics giving accepting informal support negatively linked ethics paid media coverage positive relationship practitioners perceptions difficulties increasing outputs media relations finally empirical shows new external regulations arising implementation antigraft law affect personal influence media relations korea"

Loyal customers who feel betrayed due to the violations of expectations often become the company’s worst enemies. To extend the line of research of situational crisis communication theory (SCCT), this study explored how attributed responsibility, customer-company relationship (CCR), and their interaction affect betrayal. A company’s defining attributes and customer-company identification (CCI) shape customers’ expectations for a company. This study also examined how a direct threat to a company’s defining attribute in a crisis and CCI affect betrayal. A total of 395 Whole Foods customers participated in an online quasi-experiment. The antecedent concepts from SCCT all affect betrayal, with the attributed responsibility being the strongest predictor. Customers also feel more betrayed when the crisis directly threatens the company’s defining attribute and when they strongly identify with the company. Consequently, sense of betrayal has strong effects on customers’ attitudinal, emotional, and intentional responses.","turn friends enemies causes outcomes customers sense betrayal crisis communication crises violations customers expectations company loyal customers feel betrayed due violations expectations become companys worst enemies extend line situational crisis communication scct explored attributed responsibility customercompany relationship ccr interaction affect betrayal companys defining attributes customercompany identification cci shape customers expectations company direct threat companys defining attribute crisis cci affect betrayal total whole foods customers participated online quasiexperiment antecedent concepts scct affect betrayal attributed responsibility strongest predictor customers feel betrayed crisis directly threatens companys defining attribute strongly identify company consequently sense betrayal strong effects customers attitudinal emotional intentional responses"

I claim that Bourdieu could not help but be reductive insofar as his metaphor of capital became the totalizing lens through which he understood society. First, I review Bourdieu’s forms of capital, noting how capital serves as the sine qua non of his theory of practice. Second, I situate Bourdieu within the PR literature. Third, I read Bourdieu’s “capital” through Burke’s (1941) four master tropes.

Public figures are frequently advised to use social media platforms to apologize to publics, and their apologies are often posted by news outlets or individual social media users. However, evidence suggests social media may function on an interpersonal level, yet traditional image repair strategies are based on a mass media model. Using image repair strategies based in theoretical frameworks from mass mediated and interpersonal communication, this research examined the verbal behaviors and emotions displayed by public figures apologizing on YouTube and the relationships these had to audience perceptions of sincerity and forgiveness as expressed via YouTube comments. Two studies analyzed 335 segments of video from 32 public apologies on YouTube spanning from 2009 to 2014, and 1971 posted responses. The interpersonal strategies and expression of emotions were largely unrelated to the perceptions of sincerity and forgiveness; and the image repair strategies were limited in their relatedness. However, the content of the comments, a majority of which focused on the reputation of the public figure, was associated with perceptions of sincerity. Reducing offensiveness was associated with perceptions of insincerity, as was the combination of reducing offensiveness, denial and evasion. Negative comments regarding the offender’s reputation were also associated with perceptions of insincerity. Audiences were non-forgiving if the apology was perceived as insincere, but forgiving if they perceived the apology as sincere. Implications of these results in relation to the practice and scholarship of public relations are discussed.","seeking sincerity finding forgiveness youtube apologies image repair social media become important communication tools organizations public figures particularly times crisis public figures frequently advised use social media platforms apologize publics apologies posted news outlets individual social media users evidence social media function interpersonal level yet traditional image repair strategies mass media using image repair strategies frameworks mass mediated interpersonal communication verbal behaviors emotions displayed public figures apologizing youtube relationships audience perceptions sincerity forgiveness expressed via youtube comments analyzed segments video public apologies youtube spanning posted responses interpersonal strategies expression emotions largely unrelated perceptions sincerity forgiveness image repair strategies limited relatedness content comments majority focused reputation public figure associated perceptions sincerity reducing offensiveness associated perceptions insincerity combination reducing offensiveness denial evasion negative comments offenders reputation associated perceptions insincerity audiences nonforgiving apology perceived insincere forgiving perceived apology sincere relation practice scholarship"

Pershing Square spent $50 million dollars (USD) on investigations and campaigning and this public relations output was interpreted using a combination of organizational discourse analysis and narrative analysis. Pershing Square delivered a social gain, when the regulator intervened to levy a fine to redress the losses of Herbalife distributors and ordered the company to change its business practices.

Drawing from reputation management research in marketing, it conceptualizes corporate reputations as encompassing associations related to corporate ability (CA) and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Reputation management research generally has investigated reputations as strong on either CA or CSR, but this research examines the effects of a “hybrid” reputation, which is strong in terms of both CA and CSR associations. The results of an experiment reveal that stakeholders’ responses during a crisis vary based on their expectations, how they perceive a hybrid reputation, and the crisis type.

As social media publics possess diverse, unique characteristics and communicative needs during a crisis, they form interpretative communities and co-create various symbolic interpretations of the crisis. Extending the public-centric and narrative perspective to the context of social media crises, we examined what crisis narratives were constructed by social media publics (i.e., multiplicity) and how these narratives changed by crisis stages (i.e., dynamics). Using topic modelling based on large-scale Twitter data of the Chipotle E. coli crisis (N = 40,610), we identified ten narratives subsumed under two themes (i.e., sharing-based and conversation-based) based on publics’ social constructions of their perceived risks and crisis experience. On the one hand, sharing-based narratives, heavily impacted by publics’ shared media coverage, reflected media crisis narratives and salient risk perceptions aligning with the news agenda. On the other hand, conversation-based narratives, fueled by publics’ opinion expression and emotional venting, demonstrated publics’ interpretations of their experience with the organization in the crisis with less salient but more diversified risk perceptions. Crisis managers are recommended to produce and deliver compelling narratives resonating with different groups of social media publics during crises.",""

Using thematic analysis to understand the policy and practice frameworks of community engagement in Australian local government organizations, our analyses reveal two different types of community engagement—relational and episodic—each of which has the potential to contribute to relational dimension of social capital. The study introduces and develops new thinking around the ideas of episodic and relational engagement within the context of community engagement, and their respective contributions to the development of relational capital.

The aim of the study is to investigate the multidirectional causal relationships between these three domains in terms of the use of implicit frames. An automated content analysis of Dutch newspaper articles and organizational press releases is employed. In addition, Google Trends data is examined in order to determine implicit frames of CSR among the public. Monthly level Vector Autoregression (VAR) analyses show different effects across frames. Overall, in line with our expectations, results show positive effects of the news media on the public and of organizational PR on the news media. Moreover, contrary to expectations, we found a negative effect of the public on the news media and mixed results with regard to the effect of the public on organizational PR.

Why true dialogue cannot be mandated True dialogue—as opposed to two-way communication—is a very specific and inescapably principled form of communication with benefits for all participants. This paper asks whether, given its highly-desirable form and function, governments could use legislation to require organizations to conduct true dialogue. An analysis of practitioner insights, however, shows the nature of the relationship between organisations and their stakeholders, and their perspectives on each other and the communication between them, preclude the conduct of true dialogue. The empirical data from this study allow the identification and articulation of these barriers to dialogue, moving the field of dialogue studies in public relations on from the assertion that true dialogue is hard to find in practice. This research allows practitioners and scholars alike to say why true dialogue does not happen.

Furthermore, a psychological mechanism that emphasizes employees’ perceived need satisfaction is examined as the underlying explanation that drives the effectiveness of the managerial approach. The study results support that empowering employees to co-construct CSR decisions with top management is effective in satisfying employees’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This in turn increases the employees’ intention to maintain long-lasting involvement in CSR and improves their relationships with the company.

For a crisis without a singular organization causality, such as a natural disaster, any organization can proactively initiate actions to address the situation. This article contributes to the understanding of a non-causality crisis response by identifying the capabilities that an organization needs to effectively assist with the response. An organization must possess the requisite resources, have developed key stakeholder relationships, and be driven by its own values and sense of responsibility. A sports team is well-positioned to assist with a non-causality crisis response. A sports team creates a feeling of community identity, has a vast array of resources, and has many critical stakeholder relationships.

To date, however, a paucity of research has considered how content could facilitate stakeholder support and relationships in crisis communication. The findings show that when an organization commits to transparent, interactive dialogue during a social media crisis on a social media platform, stakeholders are pulled to authentic content because they are interested and actively seeking for relevant information.

Politicians who appear to change positions must do so in a way that does not make them seem unreliable to their key stakeholders. Strategies for achieving this goal fall into four primary categories: ignore, deny, justify, and repent. Within each category are more specific tactics, such as evading questions, claiming one was misquoted, arguing one is adapting to new circumstances, or explaining that one has acquired new information about an issue.

Crisis planning models such as Reynolds and Seeger’s (2005, 2014) crisis and emergency risk communication model offer comprehensive directives for crisis managers and present opportunities to extend the utility of best practice recommendations. A survey of public information officers (PIOs) (n=208) at local public health departments across the U.S. examines the quality of their relationships with partners in public health crisis management, including first responders, media, law enforcement, and hospitals, and reveals that relationships with key publics in crisis management are lacking. Further, PIOs at state governed health departments may face critical delays in releasing crisis messages, as their messages are required to clear more levels of approval than locally (city/county) governed departments. Implications and future research for these key variables extending public relations crisis communication research with a focus on inter-organizational relationships are discussed.","influences relationship quality external partners required levels approval messaging crisis preparedness funding public health promotion increasingly limited us informing management crises threaten public health especially critical crisis planning models reynolds seegers crisis emergency risk communication comprehensive directives crisis managers present opportunities extend utility best practice recommendations survey public information officers pios local public health departments us quality relationships partners public health crisis management responders media law enforcement hospitals reveals relationships publics crisis management lacking pios state governed health departments face critical delays releasing crisis messages messages required clear levels approval locally citycounty governed departments future variables extending crisis communication focus interorganizational relationships"

Such studies help residents to be as safe as sound science, professional emergency management (including risk migration), and public communication can accomplish. Once designed and implemented, emergency response campaigns are monitored to determine what strategies work best to inform, alert and motivate vulnerable populations to make wise preventive (precrisis) emergency responses. Framed as such, this study reports data from a quasi-longitudinal analysis of community emergency management communication in one of the USA communities most at risk for chemical release/exposure. It probes the protective action decision-making motivational efficacy of a spokes-character named Wally Wise Guy. Previous research has demonstrated that knowledge of Wally and its protective response (including shelter-in-place) messaging is a strong predictor of community members’ preferred protective action and willingness to engage in such action once alerted to do so. This current study uses narrative theory, augmented by nudge theory, to further examine why Wally’s advice is useful in community emergency response. In specific, it asks whether Wally, a turtle spokes-character, nudges citizens to know and comply with emergency management advisories to shelter-in-place as notified.","narratives risk communication nudging community residents shelterplace community emergency response received researchers attention academic professional risk management communication community help residents safe sound science professional emergency management risk migration public communication accomplish designed implemented emergency response campaigns monitored determine strategies work best inform alert motivate vulnerable populations make wise preventive precrisis emergency responses framed reports data quasilongitudinal community emergency management communication usa communities risk chemical releaseexposure probes protective action decisionmaking motivational efficacy spokescharacter named wally wise guy previous demonstrated knowledge wally protective response shelterplace messaging strong predictor community members preferred protective action willingness engage action alerted current uses narrative augmented nudge wallys advice useful community emergency response asks wally turtle spokescharacter nudges citizens know comply emergency management advisories shelterplace notified"

Looking at the radical changes introduced within a historical context, the paper also provides a conceptual model of Government communication from the point where it became a recognisably government-wide service in 1956 to the period under examination. The methodological approach to this paper is qualitative using case study as the main method. A variety of data collection methods were used: ethnographic, including non-participant and participant observation, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with six senior managers in the Government Communication Service (GCS), five senior operational managers and two external experts. This primary research is supplemented by secondary sources including the academic literature and Government papers most of which are in the public domain, but some of which the author had privileged access to.

The collapse of the communist totalitarian regimes in Eastern and Central Europe and the end of the Cold War is one of key historical milestones in the history of the 20th century. However, the process itself and the consequences differed immensely from state to state: e.g., from peaceful so-called Velvet Revolution in former Czechoslovakia to the brutal civil war in former Yugoslavia. Our aim was to analyze the preconditions of the political and societal change in the Czechoslovak media – were there any signs of the change? How did the ruling party present the Soviet perestroika, which signalized a step towards democratization? The nomenklatura (ruling elite) was rather surprised by Gorbachev’s plans and feared the resemblance with the Prague Spring 1968. Nevertheless, they had to comply with the official Soviet dictate. We used Wodak’s discoursive–historical approach to analyze official propaganda reports and press agency news. We found that the Czechoslovak official nomenklatura used several argumentation and persuasive strategies to present perestroika not as a political change, but as an ongoing path towards Communism. Perestroika was presented as an accelerated path towards a classless society, however, the words were often vague or meaningless. We show that the nomenklatura welcomed perestroika verbally, but the disparity between the words and actions was omnipresent. Citizens could “read between the lines”, which meant that they revealed inner inconsistencies and problems of the regime from discoursive strategies. The aim to communicate perestroika thus served merely as an evidence of the inner disintegration of the system.","propaganda stories czechoslovakia late believe collapse communist totalitarian regimes eastern central europe end cold war historical milestones history century process consequences differed immensely state state eg peaceful called velvet revolution former czechoslovakia brutal civil war former yugoslavia aim analyze preconditions political societal change czechoslovak media signs change ruling party present soviet perestroika signalized step towards democratization nomenklatura ruling elite surprised gorbachevs plans feared resemblance prague spring nevertheless comply official soviet dictate used wodaks discoursivehistorical analyze official propaganda reports press agency news czechoslovak official nomenklatura used several argumentation persuasive strategies present perestroika political change ongoing path towards communism perestroika presented accelerated path towards classless society words vague meaningless nomenklatura welcomed perestroika verbally disparity words actions omnipresent citizens read lines meant inner inconsistencies problems regime discoursive strategies aim communicate perestroika thus served merely evidence inner disintegration system"

Existing accounts of the emergence of government public relations in the UK have tended to focus on the civil service in the first half of the twentieth century, but this article sheds light on a series of earlier developments, including the allocation of seats for reporters in the viewing gallery of the Commons in 1803, the construction of dedicated Reporters’ Galleries in both parliamentary chambers in 1847–52 and the creation of a Westminster Lobby in 1884. Taken together, these reforms improved journalists’ access to parliament in an era in which direct governmental control over newspapers lapsed. Yet, they also allowed politicians to influence media commentary by determining who was permitted access to parliament and what type of content made its way into print. A case can thus be made that Westminster, not Whitehall, played host to the earliest official attempts to manage the media in Britain, and this has important repercussions for current understandings of public relations history.","country wanted houses parliament press origins media management britain c considers topic received scant attention historiography official attempts manage press britain houses parliament eighteenth nineteenth centuries existing accounts emergence government uk tended focus civil service half twentieth century sheds light series earlier developments allocation seats reporters viewing gallery commons construction dedicated reporters galleries parliamentary chambers creation westminster lobby taken together reforms improved journalists access parliament era direct governmental control newspapers lapsed yet allowed politicians influence media commentary determining permitted access parliament content made way print case thus made westminster whitehall played host earliest official attempts manage media britain important repercussions current understandings history"

Recent scholars of public relations have rightly criticized early attempts to write the field’s history as a linear progression, from propaganda to excellence. At the same time, however, the same recent scholars have come to accept a linear conceptual change, and that “propaganda” became an impossible term in liberal democratic countries in the 1960s. By using the empirical case of the massive communication efforts initiated by the Swedish Commission on Right-Hand Traffic, which was assigned to implement right-hand traffic in 1967, this article shows that the concept of “propaganda” both occurred frequently and was used in a neutral sense. To deepen the understanding of this alternative perspective, the article both presents how the historical actors conceptualized their work, and describes how the communication work of the Commission was performed.","hday alternative perspective propaganda historiography public relation presents alternative perspective concept propaganda historiography recent scholars rightly criticized early attempts write fields history linear progression propaganda excellence time recent scholars come accept linear conceptual change propaganda became impossible term liberal democratic countries using empirical case massive communication efforts initiated swedish commission righthand traffic assigned implement righthand traffic shows concept propaganda occurred frequently used neutral sense deepen alternative perspective presents historical actors conceptualized work describes communication work commission performed"

This study reflects on how the GPRD’s practices have been affected by the country’s governing and political environments over time. It has periodized the eighty-four-years of development of the GPRD into sequential phases based on a continuum approach. The GPRD’s roles and duties are detailed based on four periods: Beginning Period, Growth Period, Full Expansion Period, and Weak Period. The GPRD was firstly positioned to be the primary government tool for introducing the concept of democracy to the Thai populace and disseminating information about government policies, activities and propagandistic campaigns. Through Thailand’s periods of political instability, World War II, the Cold War and rise of communism in Indochina, globalization, and the current digital age, the GPRD has expanded in its role within the government as the center of communication for a wide variety of governmental organizations. However, even as it has expanded and undergone re-organization, it has been criticized for being a government mouthpiece rather that a reliable source of factual information. Working under the direct oversight of the various governments led by the military, as well as both appointed and elected politicians, the GPRD has struggled to maintain a balanced public relations role at the juncture of Thai politics and public interest.","never changing story eight decades government department thailand government department gprd thailand existed forms since countrys governing system changed absolute monarchy constitutional reflects gprds practices affected countrys governing political environments time periodized eightyyears development gprd sequential phases continuum gprds roles duties detailed periods beginning period growth period full expansion period weak period gprd firstly positioned primary government tool introducing concept democracy thai populace disseminating information government policies activities propagandistic campaigns thailands periods political instability world war ii cold war rise communism indochina globalization current digital age gprd expanded role government center communication wide variety governmental organizations expanded undergone reorganization criticized government mouthpiece reliable source factual information working direct oversight governments led military appointed elected politicians gprd struggled maintain balanced role juncture thai politics public interest"

In particular, we examine how they managed to be powerfully democratic through an imaginative sensitivity to the voices of people often excluded from history; through grounding research in specific, often small, localities, and communities; and paradoxically, managing to avoid enough of the insularity associated with the notorious “little Britain” mindset to attract interest and interactions from historians across the world. Our article highlights the relevance to PR history of the following four aspects: 1) their awareness of the need to interact locally and beyond national boundaries; 2) their concern for inclusion (especially for subjects excluded or marginalized in earlier historical accounts); 3) their strategies for escaping insularity and increasing interdisciplinarity; and 4) their illustrations of imagination as a vital component in historical writing. For contemporary PR history writing we argue: that the first aspect, the fusion of the local with the post-national, has become a necessity as globalization keeps expanding; that the second, strategic inclusiveness, has urgency for a field reflecting on the social shortcomings of its own organization-centered past; that the third, interdisciplinary, has intensified in utility as fields adapt to the massive growth in different kinds of knowledge (from big data to neuroscience); and that the fourth, passionate and engaged imagination, is needed for revisionist accounts of the past to help reclaim more prosocial futures.","creatively escaping insularity encouraging internationalism british radicalism history historiography pr history learn small internationally influential group radical historians britain particular managed powerfully democratic imaginative sensitivity voices people excluded history grounding small localities communities paradoxically managing avoid enough insularity associated notorious little britain mindset attract interest interactions historians world highlights relevance pr history following aspects awareness need interact locally beyond national boundaries concern inclusion especially subjects excluded marginalized earlier historical accounts strategies escaping insularity increasing interdisciplinarity illustrations imagination vital component historical writing contemporary pr history writing argue aspect fusion local postnational become necessity globalization keeps expanding second strategic inclusiveness urgency field reflecting social shortcomings organizationcentered past third interdisciplinary intensified utility fields adapt massive growth kinds knowledge big data neuroscience fourth passionate engaged imagination needed revisionist accounts past help reclaim prosocial futures"

However, the extant research has studied civil society networks of NGOs, donors, and the media in transitional countries. This study extends the public relations model of civil society in two ways. First, it broadens the scope to an international context. Second, it draws from the multi-stakeholder issue network perspective to conceptualize a civil society network as a space where stakeholders of an issue mix their interests as they collectively address a pressing public issue. The literature on international and multi-stakeholder networks suggest that the international scope and the mixing of interests across sectors may restrict the production of social capital. The results from the social network analysis suggests that the mixing of interests across sectoral and geopolitical boundaries did not restrict the production of social capital. Rather, the patterns of the relationships among those on the core and those on the periphery of the network restricted the production of social capital. Such finding demonstrates how public relations’ functions like relationship building can have profound influences on social capital and civil society networks.

Adopting the investment model (Rusbult, 1980) as a theoretical framework and using structural equation modeling, the study develops a crisis relational maintenance model to explain how organizations can (re)build relationships with publics. Survey results show that publics’ commitment and publics’ trust are two significant mediators that influence publics’ relational behaviors post-crisis. The investment model provides a suitable framework to explain publics’ commitment to an organization, with explained variance more than 90 percent, and an organization’s relationship maintenance strategies during and post-crisis significantly affect publics’ trust. Whether an organization’s relationships with the publics can be maintained or repaired depends on whether an organization engages in these relationship maintenance strategies that prioritize publics’ need, which can be reciprocated from publics as publics reorient themselves along with the long-term goals and well-being of the relationships.

The study focusses on the personal experiences of PR leaders and considers how exploring the interplay between a leader and their context enhances understanding of the conditions under which knowledge is enacted, or rather not enacted, in different leadership situations. The discussion is informed by perspectives from organization and leadership studies which highlight the importance of reflexivity to leadership learning. In addition to applying a reflexive lens to leadership practice in public relations, the study addresses a lack of empirical research focussing on the situated experiences of PR leaders. It considers the reflexive potential of a programme of interviews with PR practitioners providing examples to illustrate the role this form of research can play in leadership studies. The context investigated concerns the work place experiences of senior PR executives who claim to be ‘empowering leaders’. The discussion of the findings focuses on how organizational power relations distort the practitioners’ espoused leadership values and engages in a process of problematization designed to challenge the uncritical promotion of normative and decontextualised approaches to leadership. The article highlights the benefits of a reflexive orientation to PR leadership research and pedagogy, while calling for the promotion of a particular form of contextual intelligence to help practitioners confront the organizational conditions which specifically impact on their ability to lead others.","knowing reflexivity leadership argues little known pr experience leadership challenges associated enacting desired leadership behaviours work place focusses personal experiences pr leaders considers interplay leader context enhances conditions knowledge enacted enacted leadership situations discussion informed perspectives organization leadership highlight importance reflexivity leadership learning addition applying reflexive lens leadership practice addresses lack empirical focussing situated experiences pr leaders considers reflexive potential programme interviews pr practitioners providing examples illustrate role form play leadership context investigated concerns work place experiences senior pr executives claim empowering leaders discussion focuses organizational power relations distort practitioners espoused leadership values engages process problematization designed challenge uncritical promotion normative decontextualised leadership highlights benefits reflexive orientation pr leadership pedagogy calling promotion particular form contextual intelligence help practitioners confront organizational conditions impact ability lead others"

It also uses market-size, organization, and individual level predictors to model Instagram postings. A content analysis of 1502 posts revealed the banks use Instagram for promotion, information dissemination, community building, and interactive engagement, in that order of prominence. The findings suggest banks operate at the confluence of visual communication through Instagram and integration of religious symbolism to serve a public relations function predicated on image and influence. In doing so, the banks tap into the wellspring of social media use by target publics by navigating a balance between obedience to Allah and meeting bank business objectives. The resulting tension between sacred and secular highlights Arab cultural values and suggests Instagram fosters individualism, which challenges Arab emphasis on collectivism and fractures the notion online platforms can effectively build meaningful relationships that characterize Arab culture.

Not well understood is how and why such co-creation modifies shared meaning, amplifies change, and even “erases” some piece of memory from the public record with the purpose of redirecting and redefining societal narratives. To help establish erasure as a concept for studying public relations, we draw from Freud’s theory of memory to establish a foundation upon which to critique strategic erasure. We adapt Freud’s theory of memory into the intersecting critique of visual rhetoric as public relations by analyzing, via narrative inquiry, remnants of Imperial Rome that have been modified, amplified, but even erased to present Rome’s modern identity. For centuries, even during Imperial Rome, leaders practiced damnatio memoriae —a modern Latin phrase that means “condemnation of memory.” We use this concept to interrogate the public relations identity process Rome’s leaders have used to modify for emphasis and even obliterate Roman elites’ names and images from the texts of public records by destroying, mutilating and modifying statues and monuments as a means for co-creating new public memory. Such analysis reveals how damnatio memoriae helps elites to redefine the “memory” of the Eternal City.","paradox erasure damnatio memoriae strategy tactic scholars organizations cocreate meaning engaged stakeholders understood cocreation modifies shared meaning amplifies change erases piece memory public record purpose redirecting redefining societal narratives help establish erasure concept studying draw freuds memory establish foundation upon critique strategic erasure adapt freuds memory intersecting critique visual rhetoric analyzing via narrative inquiry remnants imperial rome modified amplified erased present romes modern identity centuries imperial rome leaders practiced damnatio memoriae modern latin phrase means condemnation memory use concept interrogate identity process romes leaders used modify emphasis obliterate roman elites names images texts public records destroying mutilating modifying statues monuments means cocreating new public memory reveals damnatio memoriae helps elites redefine memory eternal city"

The two featured rumor types are the bogie rumor, which highlights feared outcomes, and the wedge rumor, which aims to reinforce differences between rival groups. Derived from Situational Crisis Communication Theory, the three response strategies examined are refuting the rumor, denying it, and attacking its source. Data were drawn from part of a large-scale online experiment, and the sample of the analysis was 942 South Korean adults. The experiment had a between-subjects design of 2 rumor type (wedge vs. bogie) x 3 government response strategies (refutation, denial, attack the attacker).

Compared to most previous studies that employ organization-centric networks where ties stand for hyperlinks, collaborations, or coalitions, the new approach projects organization-public relationships and public-public relationships onto interorganizational ties. By doing so, it (1) brings publics back into networked public relations research; (2) presents organizations and publics—the two most important subjects of public relations research—equally in the same network, (3) drives literature further away from a dyadic view of relationship management, and (4) constitutes one of the first techniques that can analyze direct and timely consequences of organziation-public relationships in the network ecology.

Patterns of interaction between various voices that co-construct the rhetorical crisis situation were examined using a relational analysis of statements. A symbolic network was constructed that consisted of rhetorical relations between the actors. The findings show that VW is by far the most prominent voice in the media coverage. However, this prominence is based on the fact that VW mainly appears in the role of the addressee of statements, and that many of the corporation’s statements are self-referential.

In recent years, there has been a surge in efforts to develop standards for M&E in different parts of the world. Prominent examples of this include standard terminologies, metrics, principles for best practice in the field, and evaluation frameworks. Regardless of their alleged importance, however, the acceptance and application of such M&E standards in the practice varies significantly. To better understand the process by which standards in this field are developed and adopted, this article draws on recent concepts from organization studies (cf.

Combining a cross-situational factor (i.e., pre-crisis relationship quality) and a situational factor (i.e., crisis-specific perceptions), this study segments internal publics to understand employees’ motivations of becoming advocates for or adversaries of their organization. The results of an online survey demonstrated that employees’ pre-crisis relationship to their organization plays a critical role in encouraging them to advocate for their company; meanwhile, their crisis-perception—whether they feel fewer constraints in solving a crisis—is more likely to make them share negative information externally. Segmented groups of employees with high levels of both relationship and activeness are most likely to engage in both positive and negative external communication behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications for public relations and internal crisis communication are suggested.","crisis perceptions relationship communicative behaviors employees internal public segmentation employees engage external communicative behaviors periods corporate crisis combining crosssituational factor e precrisis relationship quality situational factor e crisis perceptions segments internal publics employees motivations becoming advocates adversaries organization online survey demonstrated employees precrisis relationship organization plays critical role encouraging advocate company meanwhile crisisperception feel fewer constraints solving crisis likely make share negative information externally segmented groups employees high levels relationship activeness likely engage positive negative external communication behaviors practical internal crisis communication suggested"

This study advances understanding of publics’ crisis communicative and noncommunicative behaviors in the context of tornadoes through combining and extending two theories: the social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) model and the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS). Findings from a survey of Southeast U.S. residents (n = 1,585) indicate that STOPS is internally consistent and accurate at measuring its intended outcomes of communicative action in problem solving. However, the STOPS measures do not have a significant relationship with the desirable outcome for imminent threat crisis communication: individuals following government’s protective action guidance about tornadoes. In comparison, the expanded SMCC model predicts individuals’ self-reported compliance. Finally, variables from the SMCC model and tornado-specific variables were integrated into the STOPS model to explain individuals’ communicative engagement. Implications for theory and public relations practice are discussed.",""

Relationships are pivotal to public relations. However, their conceptualizations, measures, and normative assumptions have neither been analyzed systematically and across disciplines, nor have they been studied in light of the changing digital communication landscape. This article re-examines the relationship paradigm in public relations and marketing in an online environment. By means of a systematic review, it seeks to explicate communicative relationships between organizations and their diverse stakeholders, to review how they are operationalized and measured, and to illuminate their normative evaluations. This conceptual specification is guided by systematic sampling and content analysis of all primary research on organization-stakeholder relationships in the broader social sciences. Results of a comprehensive analysis of 74 articles suggest that studies overemphasize the business contexts, follow an instrumental orientation based on transactions rather than communication, and lack analyses of digital data. To explicate a PR understanding of digital communicative organization-stakeholder relationships, a definition is provided and a research agenda is offered on theory, measures, and blind spots.","explicating communicative organizationstakeholder relationships digital age systematic review agenda digital age gamechanger communication organizations stakeholders relationships pivotal conceptualizations measures normative assumptions neither analyzed systematically disciplines studied light changing digital communication landscape re relationship paradigm marketing online environment means systematic review seeks explicate communicative relationships organizations diverse stakeholders review operationalized measured illuminate normative evaluations conceptual specification guided systematic sampling content primary organizationstakeholder relationships broader social sciences comprehensive overemphasize business contexts follow instrumental orientation transactions communication lack analyses digital data explicate pr digital communicative organizationstakeholder relationships definition provided agenda offered measures blind spots"

Such critique pits strategic engagement needed for self-governance against self-interested framing (spin) and other dysfunctions. This theoretical essay takes stock of research literature to evaluate the ethics of organizational rhetoric, as rationale for public relations, and justify shifting from a strategic functional to an ontological, agonistic view of public relations. Relevant literature justifies the ethics of fairness (which features regard for others’ interests) to guide rhetorical processes and prefer outcomes as societally responsible. From classical Greece to postmodern theory of agonism, analysis of rhetoric centers on self-governance: achieved by stakeholders addressing rhetorical problems in rhetorical situations to deliberate strategic legitimatization. The discursive role of public relations intersects ethics of fairness and rhetorical citizenship, advocacy and dialogue, discourse and engagement at individual and societal levels. Public relations should be linked to an ontological ethics regarding strategic means of rhetorical influence toward ends accomplished collectively by agonistic pursuit.","ethical grounds organizational rhetoric organizational rhetoric critically questioned ethics strategic processes aspirational goal persuasive inescapably selfinterested influence critique pits strategic engagement needed selfgovernance selfinterested framing spin dysfunctions essay takes stock evaluate ethics organizational rhetoric rationale justify shifting strategic functional ontological agonistic view relevant justifies ethics fairness features regard others interests guide rhetorical processes prefer outcomes societally responsible classical greece postmodern agonism rhetoric centers selfgovernance achieved stakeholders addressing rhetorical problems rhetorical situations deliberate strategic legitimatization discursive role intersects ethics fairness rhetorical citizenship advocacy dialogue discourse engagement individual societal levels linked ontological ethics strategic means rhetorical influence ends accomplished collectively agonistic pursuit"

"1100",2019,"academic_review","academic","An authenticity matrix for community engagement Community engagement (CE), a key area of theory and practice in public relations, has two functions: first, to maintain and enhance relationships between organizations and diverse community groups in complex settings; and second, to give voice to these groups in addressing socially-situated problems. Implicit within these functions is CE’s ability to connect organizations with a selection of stakeholder voices that represent community perspectives on a given topic. It is the claimed representational nature of these voices that gives legitimacy to the processes and outcomes of CE. The role of public relations practitioners in CE is therefore to identify and involve voices that are authentic—that is, those that truthfully represent the extent and diversity of community sentiment. Such voices include those that are quiet or silent, even though they have a contribution to make. This study uses in-depth interviews with current practitioners to explore voice and authenticity in CE, and identifies four dimensions of CE in practice. These dimensions extend CE theory, particularly in public relations, by addressing the under-considered yet central role of authenticity in CE. The paper also draws on the dimensions to develop an Authenticity Matrix that allows CE practitioners to assess and critique their past and current CE projects. The Authenticity Matrix also provides guidance to public relations practitioners seeking to enhance the conditions for achieving authenticity in CE practice.","authenticity matrix community engagement community engagement ce area practice functions maintain enhance relationships organizations diverse community groups complex settings second give voice groups addressing sociallysituated problems implicit functions ces ability connect organizations selection stakeholder voices represent community perspectives given topic claimed representational nature voices gives legitimacy processes outcomes ce role practitioners ce therefore identify involve voices authentic truthfully represent extent diversity community sentiment voices include quiet silent though contribution make uses depth interviews current practitioners voice authenticity ce identifies dimensions ce practice dimensions extend ce particularly addressing considered yet central role authenticity ce draws dimensions develop authenticity matrix allows ce practitioners assess critique past current ce projects authenticity matrix guidance practitioners seeking enhance conditions achieving authenticity ce practice"

"1105",2019,"academic_review","academic","Public relations intersections: Statues, monuments, and narrative continuity Public relations theory addresses strategic processes, including rhetorical strategies, that enable critical understanding of why and how communities develop, promulgate, and use text, in this case, statues and monuments, to establish narrative continuity based on moral judgment in the pursuit of relatedness. That paradigm reasons that narratives provide enactable continuity that binds the past, present, and future to culturally guide coordinated discourse and action. How statues and monuments are important to that end can be demonstrated by public relations practice in the United States: Post-Civil War to today. To develop that theme, this paper discusses how statues and monuments serve as textual resources that bind time and moralize behavior through commemoration/counter commemoration. As an intersection with narrative theory, epideictic rhetoric has celebrated (or condemned) citizenship actions that reflect and define moral behavior. Such rhetoric uses moral standards to judge acts, and advocates acts as worthy of praise as they exemplify moral standards. If standards change, acts that once were lauded can become condemned as unworthy of praise. Using the civil society intersection of narrative continuity, epideictic rhetoric, and relational capital, three eras will be examined to demonstrate the issue cause-related intersection of statues/monuments in the USA: (1) Post-Civil War and Reconstruction (roughly 1868–1900), (2) Jim Crow era (late 19th and early 20th century); and (3) recent efforts to erect, protect, and remove statues and monuments that support or disrupt the narrative continuity that enacts race-based marginalization and disempowerment as relatedness tensions.","intersections statues monuments narrative continuity addresses strategic processes rhetorical strategies enable critical communities develop promulgate use text case statues monuments establish narrative continuity moral judgment pursuit relatedness paradigm reasons narratives enactable continuity binds past present future culturally guide coordinated discourse action statues monuments important end demonstrated practice united states postcivil war today develop theme discusses statues monuments serve textual resources bind time moralize behavior commemorationcounter commemoration intersection narrative epideictic rhetoric celebrated condemned citizenship actions reflect define moral behavior rhetoric uses moral standards judge acts advocates acts worthy praise exemplify moral standards standards change acts lauded become condemned unworthy praise using civil society intersection narrative continuity epideictic rhetoric relational capital eras demonstrate issue cause intersection statuesmonuments usa postcivil war reconstruction roughly jim crow era late early century recent efforts erect protect remove statues monuments support disrupt narrative continuity enacts race marginalization disempowerment relatedness tensions"

The first two experiments demonstrate that victim crises not only inflict less reputational damage than preventable crises because stakeholders consider the organization less responsible for the events, but also because they are more likely to empathize with the company.

Using a press conference simulation, spokesperson video recordings were analyzed using automated face-emotion recognition software (FaceReader™) to characterize discrete emotions. A crisis-message-strategy trained dictionary for Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was used to characterize message content. Our results indicate that spokespeople can control their verbal messages better in prepared statements than in more spontaneous settings, but their facial emotions are quite similar in both settings. Only three discrete emotions are related to credibility perceptions: anger, sadness, and surprise, but sadness and surprise are not universally viewed positively or negatively. Expressing too much emotion, or over-emoting, is problematic.

"1116",2019,"academic_review","academic","An evaluation u-turn: From narrow organisational objectives to broad accountability The development of evaluation scholarship progresses, but the slow and incremental steps taken are largely refinements on a direction of thinking that has become established and virtually taken for granted. Most frameworks and models which have gained recognition in the academy and practice follow programme logic methodology. They also point to the achievement of organisational objectives as being the principal, but not always sole, purpose of public relations programmes. The achievement of organisational objectives has therefore been the focus of evaluation. Parallel, to this, a second strand of thinking in the scholarship and practice has questioned the assumption that the meeting of organisational objectives is paramount and whether organisations alone should determine the measures of success. Other perspectives such as stakeholder judgements of success and the obligation of organisations to meet societal expectations have been discussed as legitimate ways in which to evaluate programmes and activities. This paper takes forward this second strand by proposing that the evaluation debate should be ‘flipped’. Instead of organisational objectives being a primary denominator for evaluation, the paper proposes that whether organisations discharge their accountabilities to stakeholders and society is of equal, if not more weight. An organisation will succeed only if it sustains its licence to operate. To achieve that it has to meet the reasonable expectations that licence-givers have and to obtain their active consent to support its actions. The key questions for public relations are therefore: who/what holds us to account? What are their expectations? How are their expectations fulfilled? Drawing on the management and public relations literature to answer these questions, the paper calls for a radical ‘turn’ from the prevailing thinking, which the authors suggest is more about public relations explaining and justifying itself, towards a model that aligns with contemporary management thinking and practice. The paper proposes a model and process that provides a way forwards based not only on organisational aspirations, but on a hierarchy of obligations: to society, stakeholders, the organisation, and to the professional function which runs campaigns. It offers a principles based evaluation approach. In doing so, it takes the evaluation debate in a new direction and thereby adds to theory-building. It also offers a new way forwards for the practice which has become increasingly mired in developing more comprehensive lists of indicators and metrics and expanding taxonomies of evaluation terms.","evaluation uturn narrow organisational objectives broad accountability development evaluation scholarship progresses slow incremental steps taken largely refinements direction thinking become established virtually taken granted frameworks models gained recognition academy practice follow programme logic methodology point achievement organisational objectives principal always sole purpose programmes achievement organisational objectives therefore focus evaluation parallel second strand thinking scholarship practice questioned assumption meeting organisational objectives paramount organisations alone determine measures success perspectives stakeholder judgements success obligation organisations meet societal expectations legitimate ways evaluate programmes activities takes forward second strand proposing evaluation debate flipped instead organisational objectives primary denominator evaluation proposes organisations discharge accountabilities stakeholders society equal weight organisation succeed sustains licence operate achieve meet reasonable expectations licencegivers obtain active consent support actions questions therefore holds us account expectations expectations fulfilled drawing management answer questions calls radical turn prevailing thinking explaining justifying towards aligns contemporary management thinking practice proposes process way forwards organisational aspirations hierarchy obligations society stakeholders organisation professional function runs campaigns principles evaluation takes evaluation debate new direction thereby adds building new way forwards practice become increasingly mired developing comprehensive lists indicators metrics expanding taxonomies evaluation terms"

Additionally, this study considers publications by region and the affiliations of first authors. The results show that only a small number of EOC-focused papers have been published since 1947; this area of public relations research has suffered from a lack of scholarly attention despite its relevance to various disciplines, and this is a situation that we hope improves. Recent trends have shown some reasons for optimism. We found that at least one EOC-focused paper has been published annually in most years since 2000 (the exceptions are 2001, 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2015). Our research shows that scholars in the fields of public relations, media studies, and political science published more papers on EOC than scholars in other fields. Research articles usually utilize qualitative research methodologies. Interviews stand out as the most widely used data collection method. Our analysis of publications by region and first-author affiliation shows that the majority of EOC papers were written by faculty and students working or studying in the United States. Seven perspectives frequently discussed by scholars and the most frequently used words within EOC papers are highlighted in a follow-up qualitative review.","effects relationship management community health organizations situational perceptions turn information behaviors health issues community members survey data asian americans indicated trust control mutuality played complementary roles problem recognition involvement recognition constraint recognition differently impacted information behaviors ranging information attending information forwarding information sharing information seeking proposed tested publicoriented contributed lines publiccentered consequences relationship management antecedents formation publics practical fostering relationships empowering community members systematically analyzes engineering consent eocfocused scholarly papers published using content text mining aims light progress eoc disciplines methodologies data collection methods major perspectives frequent words used writings additionally considers publications region affiliations small number eocfocused papers published since area suffered lack scholarly attention despite relevance disciplines situation hope improves recent trends shown reasons optimism least eocfocused published annually years since exceptions shows scholars fields media political science published papers eoc scholars fields usually utilize qualitative methodologies interviews stand widely used data collection method publications region author affiliation shows majority eoc papers written faculty students working studying united states seven perspectives frequently scholars frequently used words eoc papers highlighted follow qualitative review"

Because the goal of this research was to analyze the public thought leadership of public relations agencies as displayed on their websites (not agency-client relationships), both quantitative and qualitative content analyses were carried out to examine their website content. The purpose was to identify whether agencies’ ethical counsel and leadership were demonstrated; and, if they were, through which approaches and themes. Public relations agencies discussed the Trump victory in a few ways. The most popular theme was the Columnist/Blogger/Critic approach, or a personalized reflection of agency staffers on the Trump victory. The second most popular--yet less frequent--approach was as PR Counsel, aimed at providing professional advice to prepare brands for Trump’s attacks and/or take advantages of new opportunities in the Trump era. The third most popular – the Expert approach – was an in-depth analysis of an issue (for example, health care) and a Trump presidency’s implications. This study addresses implications for risk management in the political sphere of public relations. The response of the public relations industry, as evidenced on agency websites, was less than strategic: We do not practice what we preach (or sell).

Such scrutiny is important because its findings enable public relations to contribute to the debate and development of CSV from both the public’s and the organization’s viewpoints. Additionally, if public relations professionals understand how the public perceives CSV, they can give a strategic perspective to top management for maximizing moral capabilities of the business and formulate effective communication to promote CSV initiatives. This study investigates whether the public prefers corporations to practice CSV as opposed to intrinsic CSR as a separate pursuit from business interests. It also explores the role of leadership as an influential and ethical construct in implementing effective CSV as perceived by the public. The public’s preference for CSV over intrinsic CSR was revealed in a survey of 1784 participants in the United States (US), Germany, and China. Factor analysis results further suggested that effective CSV competencies of CEOs were construed as a unidimensional concept in the US, but German and Chinese participants viewed it as two-dimensional. The public perceived that leaders’ moral character played a more important, core role in effective CSV than did altruistic and behavioral attributes, across nations.

By observing the most transparent Chinese charitable foundations, this study conducted a quantitative content analysis to examine their use of WeChat for dialogic communication with publics. Particularly, this study examined the dialogic features employed on the official WeChat accounts of these foundations as well as the public engagement functions fulfilled by their WeChat posts. The findings indicate that the dialogic potential of WeChat has not been fully utilized by the Chinese foundations. The official accounts have been relatively successful in fulfilling the provision of useful information toward interested publics, but most of them still have not created a dialogic loop with their audience. The WeChat posts primarily act as information sources but also perform the salient function of calling upon actions.

Against this backdrop, what kinds of communication do churches/religious groups use to stay relevant and connect with their memberships? On the one hand, religious sociologists emphasise the importance of face-to-face communication for religious groups, to maintain authenticity and plausibility structures (especially in a pluralistic and secular world). On the other hand, media and communication scholars underline the opportunities to be found within mediated communication. This leads to the question of whether the churches’ communication with their members has shifted from face-to-face communication to more mediated communication. A comparative case study based on a multi-level mixed method design provides insights into the membership communication of the two major German denominations (Protestant and Catholic). The findings illustrate a clear shift from face-to-face to mediated communication at the upper church levels. Interestingly, only a small minority of the public relations professionals surveyed referred to the importance of face-to-face communication and its authenticity. In stark contrast to the professional level communication, congregations still concentrate on face-to-face and traditional mediated communication.","authentic church membership communication times religious transformation mediatisation european countries established christian denominations losing ground past century backdrop kinds communication churchesreligious groups use stay relevant connect memberships hand religious sociologists emphasise importance faceface communication religious groups maintain authenticity plausibility structures especially pluralistic secular world hand media communication scholars underline opportunities mediated communication leads question churches communication members shifted faceface communication mediated communication comparative case multilevel mixed method design insights membership communication major german denominations protestant catholic illustrate clear shift faceface mediated communication upper church levels interestingly small minority professionals surveyed referred importance faceface communication authenticity stark contrast professional level communication congregations concentrate faceface traditional mediated communication"

A total of 4068 respondents from mainland China completed questionnaires. Results demonstrated that institutional responsiveness indirectly reduced publics’ destructive non-institutional political participation by building institutional trust. Extending the public relations literature on dialogue, we found that this indirect relationship is conditional on online political information seeking rather than online political expression among members of the public. For people who frequently use the Internet to seek political information, institutional responsiveness is more likely to boost institutional trust, which decreases the likelihood of participation in offline political activities.","responsiveness works mainland china effects institutional trust political participation investigated institutional responsiveness constitutive element dialogic communication influences institutional trust political participation members public mainland china total respondents mainland china completed questionnaires demonstrated institutional responsiveness indirectly reduced publics destructive noninstitutional political participation building institutional trust extending dialogue indirect relationship conditional online political information seeking online political expression members public people frequently use internet seek political information institutional responsiveness likely boost institutional trust decreases likelihood participation offline political activities"

International perspectives on differences between theory and practice This paper replicates an Australian study (Lane, 2018) into how public relations practitioners understand dialogue in practice. The original study found practitioners believed they were carrying out dialogue legally required by government, but what they were doing was no more than two-way communication. It also found practitioners’ operating environments meant they could never actually undertake dialogue, even if mandated to do so. These empirically-based insights revealed the existence of gaps between theory and practice in dialogue in public relations. The study was repeated in Austria to determine if these findings were consistent internationally, and to consider what this might mean for the place of dialogue in public relations. Examples of so-called mandated ‘dialogue’ provided by Austrian public relations practitioners in semi-structured interviews were analyzed using Kent and Taylor’s (2002) five principles of dialogue. This analysis showed that despite the Austrian practitioners’ familiarity with the work of Habermas on dialogue, the mandated communication they carried out was not dialogue. The Austrian experience also showed that the nature of the underlying context of mandated communication—the need to achieve agreement between parties in varying levels of conflict; and conducting communication within boundaries of time and non-negotiable pre-existing decisions—meant dialogue could never occur. Comparing the two studies demonstrated high levels of similarity between the countries’ results, which we hope can provide the starting point for the development of a longitudinal and international perspective. This paper concludes that the place of dialogue in the theory and practice of public relations is dependent on the education of practitioners in its implementation; and a re-thinking of the role of the aspirational in situations where it can never be attained.","mandating dialogue international perspectives differences practice replicates australian lane practitioners dialogue practice original practitioners believed carrying dialogue legally required government way communication practitioners operating environments meant never actually undertake dialogue mandated empirically insights existence gaps practice dialogue repeated austria determine consistent internationally consider might mean place dialogue examples called mandated dialogue provided austrian practitioners semistructured interviews analyzed using kent taylors principles dialogue despite austrian practitioners familiarity work habermas dialogue mandated communication carried dialogue austrian experience nature underlying context mandated communication need achieve agreement parties varying levels conflict conducting communication boundaries time nonnegotiable preexisting decisionsmeant dialogue never occur comparing demonstrated high levels similarity countries hope starting point development longitudinal international perspective concludes place dialogue practice dependent education practitioners implementation rethinking role aspirational situations never attained"

"1140",2020,"academic_review","academic","Public relations, indigeneity and colonization: Indigenous resistance as dialogic anchor Cultural communication has been put forth in the context of globalization and the emergence of Indigenous movements as a framework for dialogue to be carried out by organizations (Love & Tilley, 2014). Concepts of Māori communication for instance have been foregrounded in the public relations literature to anchor strategies of effective engagement through dialogue, leading to the building of trust in Indigenous communities (Love & Tilley, 2014). Similarly, Indigenous engagement has been foregrounded as a key resource in achieving global sustainable development (Dutta, 2013, 2019). This turn to Indigenous cultural communication is broadly situated in the framing of indigeneity as a category to be developed within frameworks of dialogue and engagement, constituted within the structures of transnational capitalism (Dutta, 2019). Drawing from Dutta’s (2008) theorizing of the cultural sensitivity and culture-centered approaches to communication, we critically interrogate the hegemony of Indigenous dialogue as a strategy deployed by dominant organizations. Whereas cultural sensitivity incorporates cultural characteristics to serve organizational goals, cultural-centering serves as an anchor for collaborating with cultural communities at the margins in building “communicative infrastructures” for voice. Arguing that superficial markers of culture incorporated into engagement is a communicative inversion that serves the colonizing tools of transnational capital, we attend to culturally centered communication strategies of engagement that are grounded in resistance and emerge from within the voices of Indigenous movements that are increasingly threatened by ever-expanding colonial missions of globalization. Comparing across two case studies, one about the struggle of the Dongria Kondh in the Odisha state of Eastern India against mining capitalism, and the other a critical review of the use of Māori cultural knowledge in the public relations literature, we articulate indigeneity as a site of resistance within the meta-theoretical framework of the culture-centered approach (Dutta, 2008, 2011). In conceptualizing Indigenous resistance as an agonistic anchor to communication, we attend to the impossibilities of dialogue, and simultaneously to the role of communicative infrastructures in inverting neoliberal hegemony. Dialogue is radically transformed, not in generating consensus but rather in its capacity to disrupt the neoliberal status quo through the presence of Indigenous voices. Indigenous resistance “renders impure” the ontological category of dialogue, on one hand, attending to the limits of dialogue, and on the other hand, turns dialogic tools into the hands of Indigenous social movements. Dialogue as a communication infrastructure located materially within Indigenous resistance movements turns the power of communication into the hands of Indigenous communities.",""

We articulate the impact of not only a deliberate strategy devised by the group, but also of an emergent strategy that became evident through the choices made by the citizens in organizing the tournament. Theoretical implications of this new integrative conceptualization of citizens’ political PR for public relations scholarship are discussed.","citizens political unpacking choices emergent deliberate strategies building trust relations groups conflict manuscript integrate work political strategic management multitrack diplomacy international relations scholarship advance concept citizens political pr defined strategies choices devised organized local citizens enhance intergroup intragroup relations conflicting groups demonstrate citizens political pr action using case activity planned group organized everyday ghanaian citizens football soccer tournament helped promote better relationships conflicting communities articulate impact deliberate strategy devised group emergent strategy became evident choices made citizens organizing tournament new integrative conceptualization citizens political pr scholarship"

The unique characteristics of politicized consumer activism (i.e., consumers acting for political rather than economic reasons and being driven by a political stance rather than morality or identity) render it distinct from other frameworks, such as self-interest-motivated consumer activism, political consumer activism, and consumer nationalism. To shed light on the participants involved in politicized consumer activism, the present study includes a public segmentation analysis of a case in a Chinese context. Building on the situational theory of publics (STP), this study incorporates three objective resources—economic, social, and cultural capital—as segmenting criteria. Data were collected by sending out self-administered questionnaires, resulting in 450 valid and complete questionnaires. A two-step cluster analysis identified three segments: the inactive unprivileged group (cluster 1), the moderate elites (cluster 2), and the active middle class (cluster 3). The degree of activism was lowest in cluster 1 and highest in cluster 3. The sociological significance of segmenting publics and the manifestation of the characteristics of politicized consumer activism through the segments are discussed.","becomes online activist publics politicized consumer activism draws attention emerging phenomenon politicized consumer activism uses public segmentation identify publics involved unique characteristics politicized consumer activism e consumers acting political economic reasons driven political stance morality identity render distinct frameworks selfinterestmotivated consumer activism political consumer activism consumer nationalism light participants involved politicized consumer activism present includes public segmentation case chinese context building situational publics stp incorporates objective resourceseconomic social cultural capital segmenting criteria data collected sending selfadministered questionnaires resulting valid complete questionnaires step cluster identified segments inactive unprivileged group cluster moderate elites cluster active middle class cluster degree activism lowest cluster highest cluster sociological significance segmenting publics manifestation characteristics politicized consumer activism segments"

Dozens of theories and concepts including dialogue, engagement, identification, social presence, uses and gratifications, conversational human voice, and many others inform social media. However, what has commonly taken place in social media contexts and public relations has been the importation and application of other theories and concepts, rather than exploring and clarifying the unique features and capabilities of social media per se.

To overcome this stigmatization, a positive public relations theory that posits the positive functions of public relations in contemporary China is proposed by integrating the three public relations dimensions (i.e., communication, organization-public relationships, and ecological networks), the dialogic theory of public relations and the Chinese philosophical thinking of Yin and Yang. To achieve this, the paper first explains the cause of stigmatization in public relations. Second, it introduces the three dimensions of public relations as a profession and discipline. It then articulates how the dialogic theory of public relations and the Yin Yang philosophy contribute to the development of positive public relations. Lastly, it proposes the Taiji model of public relations and the underpinnings of positive public relations. It is important to note that positive public relations serves as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, existing theories of public relations.","constructing positive china integrating dimensions dialogic chinese philosophical thinking yin yang thirty years development mainland china suffering stigma negative connotations misconception paradoxical perception general public development constraints overcome stigmatization positive posits positive functions contemporary china proposed integrating dimensions e communication organizationpublic relationships ecological networks dialogic chinese philosophical thinking yin yang achieve explains cause stigmatization second introduces dimensions profession discipline articulates dialogic yin yang philosophy contribute development positive lastly proposes taiji underpinnings positive important note positive serves complement substitute existing"
"1145",2020,"academic_review","academic","The dialogic ladder: Toward a framework of dialogue This paper articulates the existence of different forms of ‘dialogue’, ranging from the conduct of simple two-way communication through more interactive forms culminating in true (or capital D) Dialogue. The importance of, and rationale for, the making of these distinctions is discussed in relation to the theorizing and practice of dialogue in public relations. A framework encompassing variations on the theme of dialogue is proposed in the form of a dialogic ladder that reflects the everyday usage of the term, while also preserving the existence and distinction of the normative form. The clearer and more consistent conceptualization of dialogue resulting from the dialogic ladder will assist in developing teaching curricula and associated materials that enable future researchers and practitioners to distinguish between true Dialogue and other forms. The dialogic ladder contributes to the development of dialogue theory that either expands to include dialogue-in-name-only (Kent & Theunissen, 2016), or narrows its focus to consider only true Dialogue. It will also allow identification of situations in practice where two-way communication falls short of true Dialogue, and stimulate efforts to consider why this shortfall occurs and how it might be addressed—if the conduct of true Dialogue is deemed necessary and possible. Finally, the dialogic ladder provides an alternative perspective on the role of dialogue in the two-way symmetric model of public relations.","dialogic ladder framework dialogue articulates existence forms dialogue ranging conduct simple way communication interactive forms culminating true capital d dialogue importance rationale making distinctions relation theorizing practice dialogue framework encompassing variations theme dialogue proposed form dialogic ladder reflects everyday usage term preserving existence distinction normative form clearer consistent conceptualization dialogue resulting dialogic ladder assist developing teaching curricula associated materials enable future researchers practitioners distinguish true dialogue forms dialogic ladder contributes development dialogue either expands include dialoguename kent theunissen narrows focus consider true dialogue allow identification situations practice way communication falls short true dialogue stimulate efforts consider shortfall occurs might addressed conduct true dialogue deemed necessary possible finally dialogic ladder alternative perspective role dialogue way symmetric"

On a broader level, such politically motivated advocacy is a critical facet of civil society with important implications on the societal role of public relations (Taylor, 2010). In light of the significance of politically motivated consumer advocacy to public relations, a multi-phase, exploratory study was conducted. Study 1 applies content analysis and social network analysis to examine how different interactive mechanisms on social media—retweet, mention, and reply—may affect communication within and between communities of different ideological views surrounding the boycott and buycott issues. Study 2 further explores the challenges and opportunities of fostering exchange of diverse viewpoints by identifying new social mediators—the “echoers” who propel information flow among in-group members, and the “bridgers” who initiate communication with political out-group members—and assess the key network characteristics of these social mediators. The findings of these two studies advance public relations theories on networks, intergroup communication, and civil society by illustrating how social media structure and social mediators shape the networked public discourse to facilitate or inhibit conversations between publics of different ideological orientations.","echo chambers social mediators public advocacy issue networks growing trend politically motivated consumer boycotts buycotts social media impacts companys financial bottom line fundamentally disrupts relationships firm publics cornerstone ferguson sommerfeldt kent broader level politically motivated advocacy critical facet civil society important societal role taylor light significance politically motivated consumer advocacy multiphase exploratory conducted applies content social network interactive mechanisms social mediaretweet mention reply affect communication communities ideological views surrounding boycott buycott issues challenges opportunities fostering exchange diverse viewpoints identifying new social mediators echoers propel information flow group members bridgers initiate communication political group members assess network characteristics social mediators advance networks intergroup communication civil society illustrating social media structure social mediators shape networked public discourse facilitate inhibit conversations publics ideological orientations"

However, the rationale of using social capital to influence corporate government relations in authoritarian societies is indistinct. To remedy this, we integrate Bourdieu’s (1986) and Lin’s (2001) social capital theories to explore how applying a variant form of social capital (e.g., guanxi) might shape corporate government relations in authoritarian China. A multi-method, qualitative approach was employed involving 44 interviews, participant observation and document review. The findings highlighted an underexamined “vertical” dimension of social capital (i.e., links with authority in a hierarchy), which enables corporations to exercise agency over the pre-existing and often vague regulatory environment. This study adds a new perspective to social capital with hierarchical guanxi that enriches our understanding of guanxi-based political influence in Chinese corporate government relations.","social capital guanxi political influence chinese government relations social capital emerged promising political influence rationale using social capital influence corporate government relations authoritarian societies indistinct remedy integrate bourdieus lins social capital applying variant form social capital eg guanxi might shape corporate government relations authoritarian china multimethod qualitative employed involving interviews participant observation document review highlighted underexamined vertical dimension social capital e links authority hierarchy enables corporations exercise agency preexisting vague regulatory environment adds new perspective social capital hierarchical guanxi enriches guanxi political influence chinese corporate government relations"
"1149",2020,"academic_review","academic","Made by a human like you or me: Back to the Greek classics to further develop the rhetorical paradigm of public relations The first aim of this paper is to establish some of the core assumptions and concepts that have been used to build the rhetorical paradigm for developing public relations theory. The key tenets of this paradigm are deployed to enable some critical reflection on the value of the model, and particularly the work of Heath, for scholars who accept that public relations is constituted by persuasive discourses and perpetual competition between opposing interests and values. The second aim of this paper is to explore the question of where next? How do we develop the rhetorical paradigm and take it into new directions and allow it to embrace new problems? This paper will attempt to do this by applying agonistic theories of democracy. To mirror how Heath has drawn on classical writers such as Aristotle, Isocrates and Quintilian, this paper will also draw on classical texts: Firstly, through the satirical drama and social commentary in the writing of Aristophanes; and then through Honig’s work in reinterpreting Sophocles’ play Antigone. Agonism derives from the ancient Greek word agōn - a contest or struggle. A key priniciple of classical agonism is that protagonists should seek to win acclaim and admiration by performing openly in public, and it extols plurality above dispassionate deliberation. This suggests some resonance with the dominant assumptions of the rhetorical paradigm, but more modern forms of agonism make post-foundationalist assumptions of the impossibility of any consensus existing beyond precarious hegemonic relationships. They also hold to a radical pluralism that when applied challenge widely-held assumptions that ethically grounded public relations practice is that which seeks to eliminate conflict in favour of seeking consensus. Fusing agonistic cooperation with Heath’s notion of concurrence is suggested as a means of integrating critical theory into the rhetorical paradigm.",""

"1165",2020,"academic_review","academic","Before crisis: How near-miss affects organizational trust and industry transference in emerging industries A near-miss, such as a narrowly avoided collision between vehicles, evades a full-scale accident but can generate media attention that threatens trust. In emerging industries, the effects of near-miss may extend beyond organizational boundaries and influence trust in the industry and technology. This study empirically tests these assertions by examining how media reports of near-miss affect organizational trustworthiness and how trust repair strategies after a near-miss influence organizational and industry trust and technology acceptance in the emerging commercial industry of unmanned aircraft. Notwithstanding parallels to paracrisis, near-miss communication is understudied in public relations research. Further, studies of trust in the context of crisis are recent (see Brühl et al., 2018; Fuoli et al., 2017), and have produced unexpected results that warrant continued exploration in public relations. Underpinned by attribution theory, this study adopts a 2 (near-miss cause: external, low controllability; internal, high controllability) x 3 (trust repair strategy delivered via news story: denial, excuse, apology) scenario-based experiment. This study found that near-miss reduced organizational trustworthiness regardless of whether the event was controllable or not, indicating that when it comes to trust perceptions, near-miss can operate similarly to crisis. Further, apology was the only strategy that arrested a fall in organizational trustworthiness.

National Weather Service field offices do not employ public information officers. Instead, forecasters predict the weather, craft messages, and build relationships with their publics. Scholars have called for public relations research that examines messages, including how crisis communication can help publics cope. Additionally, scholars have noted that all organizations need public relations, even if they do not employ formal public relations personnel. In our study, forecasters emphasized the need to build their publics’ tornado threat awareness and provided strategies to make weather science accessible. Forecasters discussed a variety of message strategies including avoiding fear appeals, humanizing the organization, and visualizing risks. Forecasters also built relationships with active publics through soliciting weather spotters and empowering them to prepare others for severe weather. Overall, findings expand knowledge about how organizations can employ strategic public relations to benefit society, thereby extending fully functioning society theory.","tornado warning national weather services communication strategies national weather services communication multisited rapid ethnography extends fully functioning society national weather service field offices employ public information officers instead forecasters predict weather craft messages build relationships publics scholars called messages crisis communication help publics cope additionally scholars noted organizations need employ formal personnel forecasters emphasized need build publics tornado threat awareness provided strategies make weather science accessible forecasters variety message strategies avoiding fear appeals humanizing organization visualizing risks forecasters built relationships active publics soliciting weather spotters empowering prepare others severe weather overall expand knowledge organizations employ strategic benefit society thereby extending fully functioning society"
"1167",2020,"academic_review","academic","The damage done by big data-driven public relations Over the last two decades it has been argued that public relations contributes to hegemony by corporate organizations over stakeholder groups who have less power and resources. In its original formulation, the concept of hegemony had two defining features: firstly, it was conceived of as a society-wide, macroscopic formation and second as self-reinforcing i.e. self-replicating. This article argues that the rise of big-data in public relations is a hegemonic development that further re-enforces the current institutional logics and power in the three main spheres of society: corporate, governance and civic. Using the economic notion of externalities, the authors argue that loss of agency over personal data is the unpriced, unrecognized externality that drives the big-data market. This externality is dependent on those who are the losers of agency not having the requisite information, power or resources to negotiate alternatives that might re-dress the balance. As users and proponents of the use of big data, the public relations profession has a number of key questions to answer if it is not to re-inforce arguments that it is a hegemonizing force in organizations and society. Normal economic remedies to address externalities are not adequate to a case that is both ethical as well as economic in nature. The article therefore concludes with five arguments that the public relations profession should debate to provide leadership within organisations and society.","damage done big datadriven last decades argued contributes hegemony corporate organizations stakeholder groups power resources original formulation concept hegemony defining features firstly conceived societywide macroscopic formation second selfreinforcing e selfreplicating argues rise bigdata hegemonic development reenforces current institutional logics power main spheres society corporate governance civic using economic notion externalities argue loss agency personal data unpriced unrecognized externality drives bigdata market externality dependent losers agency requisite information power resources negotiate alternatives might redress balance users proponents use big data profession number questions answer reinforce arguments hegemonizing force organizations society normal economic remedies address externalities adequate case ethical economic nature therefore concludes arguments profession debate leadership organisations society"

Results indicate that internal communication research in public relations scholarships has exponentially increased since 2011. Research topics on internal communication have diversified since 2000, from descriptive studies illustrating internal communication practices to a variety of relevant phenomena on employee and organizational outcomes. Public relations theories, such as organization–public relationship and symmetrical communication, have been frequently applied in internal communication research. In terms of methodology and sample, quantitative and qualitative methods have been equally utilized, and employees from multiple organizations were frequently used as a type of sample in a large portion of research works. The most productive researchers and institutions of internal communication research in public relations were also identified.

Next, it further conceptualized and tested the structural paths that theoretically illustrate how reputation is built across these two different groups of foreign publics. Model testing results suggested that the two groups fit well with the respective models. The results imply that the puzzle of relationship’s and reputation’s causal influences on the formation of future behavior can be solved using differentiated communication strategies.

Through digital media, they can provide information about a crisis, criticize crisis participants or defend the organization experiencing the crisis (Coombs & Holladay, 2014). Limited research exists on the active role of publics in defending the organization. A handful of studies have looked at crisis communication of active organization supporters, including faith-holders (Luoma-aho, 2015); however there is a limited amount of public relations scholarship about the nature of faith-holders, their communication under crisis circumstances, and whether they in fact attempt to help organizations in times of crisis. By using a combination of content analysis and rhetorical analysis, this paper examined the crisis communication strategies offered by the organization’s faith-holders in the comments to the crisis-related articles published on the websites of media outlets. Through a case study of Tesla Motors’ crisis, the paper determined that faith-holders are a powerful force in defending the organization during the crisis, using both traditional reputation repair strategies identified by Coombs (2015) as well as new strategies identified by the study. Faith-holders were not a monolithic group and differed in terms of what aspects of the organization they had faith. Their communication was not restricted by legal and ethical demands.

Findings demonstrate an asymmetry between passive and active communicative actions, both with respect to antecedents and the strength with which they predict prosocial behavioral support.

Their specialty was targeting women publics, and they drew on their experiences with home economics and women’s clubs to promote a variety of clients from agribusiness, heavy industry, and government and nonprofit organizations. They carved a path for other women, contributed to the development of professional standards, and influenced other practitioners to target women audiences, and their inclusion initiatives paralleled those of other groups based on diversity of race, ethnicity, and gender.","power women flanley woodward womans angle us working corporate mabel flanley sally woodward opened woman agency new york city specialty targeting women publics drew experiences home economics womens clubs promote variety clients agribusiness heavy industry government nonprofit organizations carved path women contributed development professional standards influenced practitioners target women audiences inclusion initiatives paralleled groups diversity race ethnicity gender"

In this study, we connect the concept of collective memory with a public-oriented approach to crisis communication to examine how crisis response frames and collective memory narratives were displayed by different social actors (government, organizations, and publics) on one of China’s social media platforms, Weibo. Findings from a content analysis of 9238 unique posts on three national crises (the 2010 Yushu Earthquake, the 2015 Tianjin Explosions, and the 2018 Vaccine Scandal) reveal that Chinese publics tended to adopt social issue and blaming frames, while the government and organizations were more prone to using informing and corrective action frames. When recalling and reconstructing crisis memories, Chinese publics used more power and contestation narrative, while the government frequently adopted the nationalism narrative; with trauma being the predominant narrative displayed across the three crises and social actors. Crisis response frames of blaming, crediting, and corrective action were significantly associated with narratives of power and contestation, heroism, and nationalism, respectively. Theoretical implications for future research on crisis collective memory making on social media and suggestions for governmental crisis communication are discussed.","crisis collective memory making social media case chinese crises weibo social media users collectively reconstruct narratives create memories surrounding past crises connect concept collective memory publicoriented crisis communication crisis response frames collective memory narratives displayed social actors government organizations publics chinas social media platforms weibo content unique posts national crises yushu earthquake tianjin explosions vaccine scandal reveal chinese publics tended adopt social issue blaming frames government organizations prone using informing corrective action frames recalling reconstructing crisis memories chinese publics used power contestation narrative government frequently adopted nationalism narrative trauma predominant narrative displayed crises social actors crisis response frames blaming crediting corrective action significantly associated narratives power contestation heroism nationalism respectively future crisis collective memory making social media suggestions governmental crisis communication"

Through the lens of systems theory, the research investigated whether the practiced public relations roles allow organizations to perform all three boundary spanning functions such as output, throughput, and input. The results confirmed prior theoretically and empirically derived typology of roles (technician, manager, strategist) from the African continent. However, the observed structures of public relations roles deviate from previous findings, indicating that Zimbabwean PR practitioners' professional roles may differ from those in neighboring countries.","exploratory roles zimbabwe exploratory practice zimbabwe surveying roles typically practiced zimbabwean pr practitioners lens systems investigated practiced roles allow organizations perform boundary spanning functions output throughput input confirmed prior theoretically empirically derived typology roles technician manager strategist african continent observed structures roles deviate previous indicating zimbabwean pr practitioners professional roles differ neighboring countries"

Using an inductive topic modeling and text analytical approach, the study analyzes more than 100,000 original tweets on polarized discussions on Gillette’s controversial campaign addressing toxic masculinity. Results suggest that influencers serve as ideological hyper-prototypes that attract significant attention equally from supporters and detractors, while hashtags and users’ reference of current events span the conversations across multiple contexts. Study results also indicate that horizontal information cascades from external ideologically centered sources that serve users’ identity and ideological signaling are a potential contributor of discourse polarization. Based on the study results, an identity- and representation-based approach to understanding socially mediated discourses is proposed, and four parameters of socially mediated engagement identified to further theorize engagement for public relations research in digital contexts.","setting socially mediated engagement parameters topic modeling text analytic polarized discourses gillettes campaign opinions social political issues easily polarized socially mediated contexts using inductive topic modeling text analytical analyzes original tweets polarized discussions gillettes controversial campaign addressing toxic masculinity influencers serve ideological hyperprototypes attract attention equally supporters detractors hashtags users reference current events span conversations multiple contexts horizontal information cascades external ideologically centered sources serve users identity ideological signaling potential contributor discourse polarization identity representation socially mediated discourses proposed parameters socially mediated engagement identified theorize engagement digital contexts"

This study examined the engagement of university alumni with their alma mater, with data collected from qualitative interviews, a pilot survey, and a main survey. Results identified three dimensions of alumni engagement: instrumental, communicative and affective, and confirmatory factor analysis supported this three-dimensional structure. Structural equation modeling showed that, while conversational voice was conducive to alumni engagement, openness and assurances of legitimacy did not exert any significant impacts. The findings offer concrete ways in which universities can better engage with alumni, as well as conceptual and methodological ways in which public relations scholars might continue to refine the notion of engagement between organizations and their publics.","conceptualizing operationalizing alumni engagement conversational voice matters openness assurances legitimacy question organizations engage stakeholders seen increasing investigation recent years researchers concept engagement cognitive affective behavioral perspectives eg dhanesh jelensanchez engagement university alumni alma mater data collected qualitative interviews pilot survey main survey identified dimensions alumni engagement instrumental communicative affective confirmatory factor supported dimensional structure structural equation modeling conversational voice conducive alumni engagement openness assurances legitimacy exert impacts concrete ways universities better engage alumni conceptual methodological ways scholars might continue refine notion engagement organizations publics"

As will be discussed, the notion of the public interest is complex. Still, our analysis focuses on the process whereby the notion is communicatively constructed through negotiations where public relations plays an important role. The paper analyzes 58 qualitative interviews with public relations practitioners and lobbyists. We unpack the rhetorical strategies they use when they talk about the public interest and its relation to their organization. The practitioners primarily refer to positive economic consequences created by their employer. Frequently, they conflate the core activity of their organization with the public interest. The theoretical contribution of the paper is in demonstrating the versatility and dynamic aspect of ""the public interest"" as a tool to create a social license to operate. Beyond the material topic of economy, the practitioners highlighted contributions in areas such as public health, democracy and the environment.","appeals public interest lobbying create social license operate organizations social license operate depends acts according social norms engages stakeholders meets kind public interest notion public interest complex focuses process whereby notion communicatively constructed negotiations plays important role analyzes qualitative interviews practitioners lobbyists unpack rhetorical strategies use talk public interest relation organization practitioners primarily refer positive economic consequences created employer frequently conflate core activity organization public interest contribution demonstrating versatility dynamic aspect public interest tool create social license operate beyond material topic economy practitioners highlighted contributions areas public health democracy environment"

"1204",2020,"academic_review","academic","Social representation of PR activism: Perceptions of early career public relations professionals in South Africa A critical, socio-cultural turn in the public relations research agenda has shifted attention away from a predominately organisational focus to include the individual practitioner, and their symbolic power relationships (Curtin & Gaither, 2005). This has resulted in critical interrogation of issues such as dissent, power and activism in professional role enactment with an emergent, activist stance that actively questions and resists existing power structures and normative practices (Holtzhausen, 2012). This turn requires PR as well as in a diverse range of other disciplines to find new forms of addressing some of the wicked problems of our time, such as the social and cultural influences that public relations practitioners are subject to in enacting culturally sensitive public relations roles in their practice. The positioning of the critical-cultural and postmodern paradigms lends itself to the application of social representation theory (SRT) as a framework for analysis and understanding (Bauer & Gaskell, 2008; p. 351). However, to date limited research has been conducted on the social influences public relations practitioners are subject to in enacting culturally sensitive public relations roles in their practice, especially in respect of public relations practitioners who occupy junior to mid-level positions in formal employment contexts. In particular, individual influence and agency of entry level or early career public relations practitioners in South Africa has been under researched. It is against this background that this study aims to determine the perceptions of early-mid career South African PRPs on how they socially represent their activism in a poly-contextual and diverse cultural context. This is especially important in a context where PRPs are required to justify the value their actions have in achieving social change. The findings suggest that South African activist public relations practitioner (PRP) role enactment may not only entail promoting the interests of those who are marginalised and excluded from social contexts, but also requires advocating for the legitimacy of their own activist role in their contexts of practice.","social representation pr activism perceptions early career professionals south africa critical sociocultural turn agenda shifted attention away predominately organisational focus include individual practitioner symbolic power relationships curtin gaither resulted critical interrogation issues dissent power activism professional role enactment emergent activist stance actively questions resists existing power structures normative practices holtzhausen turn requires pr diverse range disciplines find new forms addressing wicked problems time social cultural influences practitioners subject enacting culturally sensitive roles practice positioning criticalcultural postmodern paradigms lends application social representation srt framework bauer gaskell p date limited conducted social influences practitioners subject enacting culturally sensitive roles practice especially respect practitioners occupy junior midlevel positions formal employment contexts particular individual influence agency entry level early career practitioners south africa researched background aims determine perceptions earlymid career south african prps socially represent activism polycontextual diverse cultural context especially important context prps required justify value actions achieving social change south african activist practitioner prp role enactment entail promoting interests marginalised excluded social contexts requires advocating legitimacy activist role contexts practice"

This study reviewed the messaging used by the fracking industry and its supporters, examining 1,515 text articles (e.g., news accounts, op-eds, etc.) and also 38 Facebook posts from pro-fracking groups. Using Schudson’s (1997) binary framework for public talk, we found that public relations messaging often moved beyond the two realms of problem-solving and sociable messaging. In this case, pro-fracking interests emulated public talk, or conversation, by also offering a blend of problem-solving and sociable talk, what this study calls an “interface” point between Schudson’s binary. This case study found this interface point to be characterized by cohesion messages, or messages that emphasized to audiences that the well-being of fracking operations and Colorado communities were interwoven. This study’s findings point to implications regarding how public relations can attempt to emulate public talk across a spectrum so as to influence democratic deliberation on contemporary issues.","emulation conversation case proposition spectrum persuasion fracking industry colorado embarked initiative defeat proposition measure industry saw existential threat reviewed messaging used fracking industry supporters text eg news accounts opeds etc facebook posts profracking groups using schudsons binary framework public talk messaging moved beyond realms problemsolving sociable messaging case profracking interests emulated public talk conversation offering blend problemsolving sociable talk calls interface point schudsons binary case interface point characterized cohesion messages messages emphasized audiences fracking operations colorado communities interwoven s point attempt emulate public talk spectrum influence democratic deliberation contemporary issues"

Merging fear appeal studies with the defensive attribution hypothesis Guided by fear appeal effect theories and the defensive attribution hypothesis, the current study examined the influence of the threat and efficacy messages in instructing and adjusting information on crisis responsibility and organizational reputation. Study 1 adopted a 2 (high vs. low threat in instructing information) × 2 (high vs. low self efficacy for instructing information) × 2 (high vs. low proxy efficacy for adjusting information) experiment and revealed that the high threat message significantly increased the attribution of crisis responsibility and further harmed organizational reputation. The high proxy efficacy message in adjusting information helped protect the organizational reputation, however, the effect was not mediated by crisis responsibility. Study 2 replicated the first experiment using a different crisis and introduced fear to the research model. Conclusions in Study 1 were largely reinforced. Fear was observed to indirectly influence organizational reputation via crisis responsibility. The mixed results of threat and efficacy in instructing and adjusting information encouraged managerial considerations when organizations design initial crisis responses.",""

Indeed, the profession’s rapid adoption of SMIs as part of their campaigns raises questions regarding the ethics of their use and the extent to which they fit with normative models of public relations practice that promote genuine dialogue and responsible advocacy. This study explores this tension between the uses and potential misuses of SMIs by examining the worldviews, strategies and practices of senior public relations practitioners at several agencies in Sydney, Australia. It proposes a new critical framework for understanding the influences that SMIs are in fact having on public relations practice, which builds on models of dialogic public relations and a critical eco-systems perspective. Ultimately, this study argues that the affordances provided by the emergence of SMIs are predisposing practitioners to persuasive strategies and covert activities that lack transparency and are inconsistent with ethical ideals of best practice for organizational public relations.","irresistible possibilities uses consequences social media influencers contemporary proliferation social media technologies seen practitioners adapt practices emergent digital media ecologies growing phenomenon social media influencers smis presenting new opportunities challenges industry indeed professions rapid adoption smis campaigns raises questions ethics use extent fit normative models practice promote genuine dialogue responsible advocacy tension uses potential misuses smis worldviews strategies practices senior practitioners several agencies sydney australia proposes new critical framework influences smis fact practice builds models dialogic critical ecosystems perspective ultimately argues affordances provided emergence smis predisposing practitioners persuasive strategies covert activities lack transparency inconsistent ethical ideals best practice organizational"
